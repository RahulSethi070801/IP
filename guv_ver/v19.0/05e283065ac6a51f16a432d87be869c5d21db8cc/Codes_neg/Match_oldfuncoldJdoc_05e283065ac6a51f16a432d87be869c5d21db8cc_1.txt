   * Adds the {@code Runnable} and accompanying {@code Executor} to the list of
   * listeners to execute. If execution has already begun, the listener is
   * executed immediately.
   *
   * <p>Note: For fast, lightweight listeners that would be safe to execute in
   * any thread, consider {@link MoreExecutors#directExecutor}. For heavier
   * listeners, {@code directExecutor()} carries some caveats: First, the
   * thread that the listener runs in depends on whether the {@code
   * ExecutionList} has been executed at the time it is added. In particular,
   * listeners may run in the thread that calls {@code add}. Second, the thread
   * that calls {@link #execute} may be an internal implementation thread, such
   * as an RPC network thread, and {@code directExecutor()} listeners may
   * run in this thread. Finally, during the execution of a {@code
   * directExecutor} listener, all other registered but unexecuted
   * listeners are prevented from running, even if those listeners are to run
   * in other executors.
