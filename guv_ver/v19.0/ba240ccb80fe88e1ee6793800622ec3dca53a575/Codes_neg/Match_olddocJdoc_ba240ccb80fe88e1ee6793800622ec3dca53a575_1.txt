   * Creates a {@code HashMap} instance, with a high enough "initial capacity"
   * that it <i>should</i> hold {@code expectedSize} elements without growth.
   * This behavior cannot be broadly guaranteed, but it is observed to be true
   * for OpenJDK 1.6. It also can't be guaranteed that the method isn't
   * inadvertently <i>oversizing</i> the returned map.
   *
   * @param expectedSize the number of elements you expect to add to the
   *        returned map
   * @return a new, empty {@code HashMap} with enough capacity to hold {@code
   *         expectedSize} elements without resizing
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code expectedSize} is negative
