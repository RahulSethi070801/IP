   * Reads a count corresponding to a serialized map, multiset, or multimap. It
   * returns the size of a map serialized by {@link
   * #writeMap(Map, ObjectOutputStream)}, the number of distinct elements in a
   * multiset serialized by {@link
   * #writeMultiset(Multiset, ObjectOutputStream)}, or the number of distinct
   * keys in a multimap serialized by {@link
   * #writeMultimap(Multimap, ObjectOutputStream)}.
   *
   * <p>The returned count may be used to construct an empty collection of the
   * appropriate capacity before calling any of the {@code populate} methods.
