   * Creates a fluent iterable with the first {@code size} elements of this
   * fluent iterable. If this fluent iterable does not contain that many elements,
   * the returned fluent iterable will have the same behavior as this fluent iterable.
   * The returned fluent iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} if this
   * fluent iterable's iterator does.
   *
   * @param size the maximum number of elements in the returned fluent iterable
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code size} is negative
