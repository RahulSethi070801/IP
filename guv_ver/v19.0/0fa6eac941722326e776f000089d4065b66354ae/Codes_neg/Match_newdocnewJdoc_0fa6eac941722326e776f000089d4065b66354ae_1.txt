   * Returns an immutable map whose keys are the distinct elements of this {@code FluentIterable}
   * and whose value for each key was computed by {@code valueFunction}. The map's iteration order
   * is the order of the first appearance of each key in this iterable.
   *
   * <p>When there are multiple instances of a key in this iterable, it is unspecified whether
   * {@code valueFunction} will be applied to more than one instance of that key and, if it is,
   * which result will be mapped to that key in the returned map.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> TODO (note that Collectors.toMap would trash the order...)
   *
   * @throws NullPointerException if any element of this iterable is {@code null}, or if {@code
   *     valueFunction} produces {@code null} for any key
   * @since 14.0
