   * Creates a {@link BloomFilter BloomFilter<T>} with the expected number of
   * insertions and a default expected false positive probability of 3%.
   *
   * <p>Note that overflowing a {@code BloomFilter} with significantly more elements
   * than specified, will result in its saturation, and a sharp deterioration of its
   * false positive probability.
   *
   * <p>The constructed {@code BloomFilter<T>} will be serializable if the provided
   * {@code Funnel<T>} is.
   *
   * @param funnel the funnel of T's that the constructed {@code BloomFilter<T>} will use
   * @param expectedInsertions the number of expected insertions to the constructed
   *     {@code BloomFilter<T>}; must be positive
   * @return a {@code BloomFilter}
