   * Returns a list of delegate futures that correspond to the futures received in the order
   * that they complete. Delegate futures return the same value or throw the same exception
   * as the corresponding input future returns/throws.
   *
   * <p>Cancelling a delegate future has no effect on any input future, since the delegate future
   * does not correspond to a specific input future until the appropriate number of input
   * futures have completed. At that point, it is too late to cancel the input future.
   * The input future's result, which cannot be stored into the cancelled delegate future,
   * is ignored.
