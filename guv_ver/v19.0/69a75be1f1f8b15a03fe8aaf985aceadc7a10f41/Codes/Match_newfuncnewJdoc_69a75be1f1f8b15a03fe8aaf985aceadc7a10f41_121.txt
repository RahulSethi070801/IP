   * Returns the {@link ScheduledExecutorService} that will be used to execute the {@link #startUp},
   * {@link #runOneIteration} and {@link #shutDown} methods. If this method is overridden the
   * executor will not be {@linkplain ScheduledExecutorService#shutdown shutdown} when this service
   * {@linkplain Service.State#TERMINATED terminates} or {@linkplain Service.State#TERMINATED
   * fails}. Subclasses may override this method to supply a custom {@link ScheduledExecutorService}
   * instance. This method is guaranteed to only be called once.
   *
   * <p>By default this returns a new {@link ScheduledExecutorService} with a single thread thread
   * pool that sets the name of the thread to the {@linkplain #serviceName() service name}. Also,
   * the pool will be {@linkplain ScheduledExecutorService#shutdown() shut down} when the service
   * {@linkplain Service.State#TERMINATED terminates} or {@linkplain Service.State#TERMINATED
   * fails}.
