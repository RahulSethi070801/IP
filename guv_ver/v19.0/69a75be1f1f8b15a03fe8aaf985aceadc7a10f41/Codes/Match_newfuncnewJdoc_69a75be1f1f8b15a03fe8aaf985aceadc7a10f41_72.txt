     * The "real" initialization; we can't put this in the constructor because, in the case where
     * futures are already complete, we would not initialize the subclass before calling {@link
     * #handleOneInputDone}. As this is called after the subclass is constructed, we're guaranteed
     * to have properly initialized the subclass.
