   * Returns an immutable set containing each of {@code elements}, minus duplicates, in the order
   * each appears first in the source collection.
   *
   * <p><b>Performance note:</b> In certain cases when {@code elements} is an {@link
   * ImmutableCollection}, its data will be reused directly without copying; the {@code elements}
   * instance itself might even be returned. The specific circumstances in which these optimizations
   * happen are undefined and subject to change.
   *
   * @throws NullPointerException if any of {@code elements} is null
   * @since 7.0 (source-compatible since 2.0)
