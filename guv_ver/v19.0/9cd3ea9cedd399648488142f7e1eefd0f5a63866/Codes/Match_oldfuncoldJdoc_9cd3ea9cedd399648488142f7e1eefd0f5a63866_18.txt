     * Returns a string in the format specified by
     * {@link MoreObjects#toStringHelper(Object)}.
     *
     * <p>After calling this method, you can keep adding more properties to later
     * call toString() again and get a more complete representation of the
     * same object; but properties cannot be removed, so this only allows
     * limited reuse of the helper instance. The helper allows duplication of
     * properties (multiple name/value pairs with the same name can be added).
