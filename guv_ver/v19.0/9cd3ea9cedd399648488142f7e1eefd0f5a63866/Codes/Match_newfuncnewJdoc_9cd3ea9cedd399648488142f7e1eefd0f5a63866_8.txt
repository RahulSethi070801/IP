   * Creates an instance of {@link ToStringHelper} in the same manner as {@link
   * #toStringHelper(Object)}, but using the simple name of {@code clazz} instead of using an
   * instance's {@link Object#getClass()}.
   *
   * <p>Note that in GWT, class names are often obfuscated.
   *
   * @param clazz the {@link Class} of the instance
   * @since 18.0 (since 7.0 as {@code Objects.toStringHelper()}).
