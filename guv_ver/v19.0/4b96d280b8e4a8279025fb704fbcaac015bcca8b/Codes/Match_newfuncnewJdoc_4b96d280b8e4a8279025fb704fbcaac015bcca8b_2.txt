   * Returns an immutable map whose keys are the distinct elements of {@code
   * keys} and whose value for each key was computed by {@code valueFunction}.
   * The map's iteration order is the order of the first appearance of each key
   * in {@code keys}.
   *
   * <p>When there are multiple instances of a key in {@code keys}, it is
   * unspecified whether {@code valueFunction} will be applied to more than one
   * instance of that key and, if it is, which result will be mapped to that
   * key in the returned map.
   *
   * @throws NullPointerException if any element of {@code keys} is
   *     {@code null}, or if {@code valueFunction} produces {@code null}
   *     for any key
