   * Returns an immutable map whose keys are the distinct elements of {@code
   * keys} and whose value for each key was computed by {@code valueFunction}.
   * The map's iteration order is the order of the first appearance of each key
   * in {@code keys}.
   *
   * <p>If {@code keys} is a {@link Set}, a live view can be obtained instead of
   * a copy using {@link Maps#asMap(Set, Function)}.
   *
   * @throws NullPointerException if any element of {@code keys} is
   *     {@code null}, or if {@code valueFunction} produces {@code null}
   *     for any key
   * @since 14.0
