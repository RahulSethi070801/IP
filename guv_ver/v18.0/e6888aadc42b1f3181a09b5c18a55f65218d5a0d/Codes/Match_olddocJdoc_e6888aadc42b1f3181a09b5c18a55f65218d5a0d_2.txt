   * Registers a {@link Listener} to be {@linkplain Executor#execute executed} on the given 
   * executor. The listener will not have previous state changes replayed, so it is 
   * suggested that listeners are added before any of the managed services are 
   * {@linkplain Service#startAsync started}.
   *
   * <p>There is no guaranteed ordering of execution of listeners, but any listener added through 
   * this method is guaranteed to be called whenever there is a state change.
   *
   * <p>Exceptions thrown by a listener will be propagated up to the executor. Any exception thrown 
   * during {@code Executor.execute} (e.g., a {@code RejectedExecutionException} or an exception 
   * thrown by {@linkplain MoreExecutors#sameThreadExecutor inline execution}) will be caught and
   * logged.
   * 
   * <p> For fast, lightweight listeners that would be safe to execute in any thread, consider 
   * calling {@link #addListener(Listener)}.
   * 
   * @param listener the listener to run when the manager changes state
   * @param executor the executor in which the listeners callback methods will be run.
