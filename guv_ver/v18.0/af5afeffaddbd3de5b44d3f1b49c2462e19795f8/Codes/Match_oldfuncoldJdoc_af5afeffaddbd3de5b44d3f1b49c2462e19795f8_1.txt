   * Parses the specified string as a signed decimal integer value. The ASCII
   * character {@code '-'} (<code>'&#92;u002D'</code>) is recognized as the
   * minus sign.
   *
   * <p>Unlike {@link Integer#parseInt(String)}, this method returns
   * {@code null} instead of throwing an exception if parsing fails.
   *
   * <p>Note that strings prefixed with ASCII {@code '+'} are rejected, even
   * under JDK 7, despite the change to {@link Integer#parseInt(String)} for
   * that version.
   *
   * @param string the string representation of an integer value
   * @return the integer value represented by {@code string}, or {@code null} if
   *     {@code string} has a length of zero or cannot be parsed as an integer
   *     value
   * @since 11.0
