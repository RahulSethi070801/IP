   * Registers a {@link Listener} to be run when this {@link ServiceManager} changes state. The 
   * listener will not have previous state changes replayed, so it is suggested that listeners are 
   * added before any of the managed services are {@linkplain Service#startAsync started}.
   *
   * <p>There is no guaranteed ordering of execution of listeners, but any listener added through 
   * this method is guaranteed to be called whenever there is a state change.
   *
   * <p>Exceptions thrown by a listener will be will be caught and logged.
   * 
   * @param listener the listener to run when the manager changes state
