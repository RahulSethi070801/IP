   * This method is called by {@link #start} to initiate service startup. The invocation of this
   * method should cause a call to {@link #notifyStarted()}, either during this method's run, or
   * after it has returned. If startup fails, the invocation should cause a call to
   * {@link #notifyFailed(Throwable)} instead.
   *
   * <p>This method should return promptly; prefer to do work on a different thread where it is
   * convenient. It is invoked exactly once on service startup, even when {@link #start} is called
   * multiple times.
