   * Creates an {@code ImmutableMapEntry} array to hold parameterized entries. The result must never
   * be upcast back to ImmutableMapEntry[] (or Object[], etc.), or allowed to escape the class.
   *
   * <p>The returned array has all its elements set to their initial null values. However, we don't
   * declare it as {@code @Nullable ImmutableMapEntry[]} because our checker doesn't require newly
   * created arrays to have a {@code @Nullable} element type even when they're created directly with
   * {@code new ImmutableMapEntry[...]}, so it seems silly to insist on that only here.
