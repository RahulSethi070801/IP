   * Gets the value from an entry. Returns null if the entry is invalid, partially-collected,
   * loading, or expired. Unlike {@link Segment#getLiveValue} this method does not attempt to clean
   * up stale entries. As such it should only be called outside a segment context, such as during
   * iteration.
