   * Closes the given {@link Reader}, logging any {@code IOException} that's thrown rather than
   * propagating it.
   *
   * <p>While it's not safe in the general case to ignore exceptions that are thrown when closing an
   * I/O resource, it should generally be safe in the case of a resource that's being used only for
   * reading, such as a {@code Reader}. Unlike with writable resources, there's no chance that a
   * failure that occurs when closing the reader indicates a meaningful problem such as a failure to
   * flush all bytes to the underlying resource.
   *
   * @param reader the reader to be closed, or {@code null} in which case this method does nothing
