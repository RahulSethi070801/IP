   * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into an {@code ImmutableSortedMultiset}
   * whose elements are the result of applying {@code elementFunction} to the inputs, with counts
   * equal to the result of applying {@code countFunction} to the inputs.
   *
   * <p>If the mapped elements contain duplicates (according to {@code comparator}), the first
   * occurrence in encounter order appears in the resulting multiset, with count equal to the sum of
   * the outputs of {@code countFunction.applyAsInt(t)} for each {@code t} mapped to that element.
