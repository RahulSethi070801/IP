   * A sensible definition of {@link #setCount(Object, int)} in terms of {@link #count(Object)},
   * {@link #add(Object, int)}, and {@link #remove(Object, int)}. {@link #entrySet()}. If you
   * override any of these methods, you may wish to override {@link #setCount(Object, int)} to
   * forward to this implementation.
