   * Returns an unmodifiable view of the union of two multisets. In the returned multiset, the count
   * of each element is the <i>maximum</i> of its counts in the two backing multisets. The iteration
   * order of the returned multiset matches that of the element set of {@code multiset1} followed by
   * the members of the element set of {@code multiset2} that are not contained in {@code
   * multiset1}, with repeated occurrences of the same element appearing consecutively.
   *
   * <p>Results are undefined if {@code multiset1} and {@code multiset2} are based on different
   * equivalence relations (as {@code HashMultiset} and {@code TreeMultiset} are).
