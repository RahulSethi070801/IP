   * Returns a view of this multiset restricted to the range between {@code lowerBound} and {@code
   * upperBound}. The returned multiset is a view of this multiset, so changes to one will be
   * reflected in the other. The returned multiset supports all operations that this multiset
   * supports.
   *
   * <p>The returned multiset will throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException} on attempts to add
   * elements outside its range.
   *
   * <p>This method is equivalent to {@code tailMultiset(lowerBound,
   * lowerBoundType).headMultiset(upperBound, upperBoundType)}.
