   * Returns a view of the elements of {@code unfiltered} that satisfy a predicate. The returned
   * multiset is a live view of {@code unfiltered}; changes to one affect the other.
   *
   * <p>The resulting multiset's iterators, and those of its {@code entrySet()} and {@code
   * elementSet()}, do not support {@code remove()}. However, all other multiset methods supported
   * by {@code unfiltered} are supported by the returned multiset. When given an element that
   * doesn't satisfy the predicate, the multiset's {@code add()} and {@code addAll()} methods throw
   * an {@link IllegalArgumentException}. When methods such as {@code removeAll()} and {@code
   * clear()} are called on the filtered multiset, only elements that satisfy the filter will be
   * removed from the underlying multiset.
   *
   * <p>The returned multiset isn't threadsafe or serializable, even if {@code unfiltered} is.
   *
   * <p>Many of the filtered multiset's methods, such as {@code size()}, iterate across every
   * element in the underlying multiset and determine which elements satisfy the filter. When a live
   * view is <i>not</i> needed, it may be faster to copy the returned multiset and use the copy.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> {@code predicate} must be <i>consistent with equals</i>, as documented at
   * {@link Predicate#apply}. Do not provide a predicate such as {@code
   * Predicates.instanceOf(ArrayList.class)}, which is inconsistent with equals. (See {@link
   * Iterables#filter(Iterable, Class)} for related functionality.)
