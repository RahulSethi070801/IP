   * Adds a single occurrence of the specified element to this multiset.
   *
   * <p>This method refines {@link Collection#add}, which only <i>ensures</i> the presence of the
   * element, to further specify that a successful call must always increment the count of the
   * element, and the overall size of the collection, by one.
   *
   * <p>To both add the element and obtain the previous count of that element, use {@link
   * #add(Object, int) add}{@code (element, 1)} instead.
   *
   * @param element the element to add one occurrence of; may be null only if explicitly allowed by
   *     the implementation
   * @return {@code true} always, since this call is required to modify the multiset, unlike other
   *     {@link Collection} types
   * @throws NullPointerException if {@code element} is null and this implementation does not permit
   *     null elements
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} occurrences of {@code element}
   *     are already contained in this multiset
