   * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a multiset created via the specified
   * {@code Supplier}, whose elements are the result of applying {@code elementFunction} to the
   * inputs, with counts equal to the result of applying {@code countFunction} to the inputs.
   * Elements are added in encounter order.
   *
   * <p>If the mapped elements contain duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals}), the element
   * will be added more than once, with the count summed over all appearances of the element.
   *
   * <p>Note that {@code stream.collect(toMultiset(function, e -> 1, supplier))} is equivalent to
   * {@code stream.map(function).collect(Collectors.toCollection(supplier))}.
   *
   * <p>To collect to an {@link ImmutableMultiset}, use {@link
   * ImmutableMultiset#toImmutableMultiset}.
