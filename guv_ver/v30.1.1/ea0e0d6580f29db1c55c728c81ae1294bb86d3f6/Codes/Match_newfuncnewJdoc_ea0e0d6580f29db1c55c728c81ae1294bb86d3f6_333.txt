   * Returns a view of this multiset restricted to the elements less than {@code upperBound},
   * optionally including {@code upperBound} itself. The returned multiset is a view of this
   * multiset, so changes to one will be reflected in the other. The returned multiset supports all
   * operations that this multiset supports.
   *
   * <p>The returned multiset will throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException} on attempts to add
   * elements outside its range.
