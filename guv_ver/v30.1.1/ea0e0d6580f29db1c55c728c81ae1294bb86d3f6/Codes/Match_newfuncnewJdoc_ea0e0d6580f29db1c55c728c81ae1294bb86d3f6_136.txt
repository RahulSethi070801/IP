   * Adds or removes the necessary occurrences of an element such that the element attains the
   * desired count.
   *
   * @param element the element to add or remove occurrences of; may be null only if explicitly
   *     allowed by the implementation
   * @param count the desired count of the element in this multiset
   * @return the count of the element before the operation; possibly zero
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code count} is negative
   * @throws NullPointerException if {@code element} is null and this implementation does not permit
   *     null elements. Note that if {@code count} is zero, the implementor may optionally return
   *     zero instead.
