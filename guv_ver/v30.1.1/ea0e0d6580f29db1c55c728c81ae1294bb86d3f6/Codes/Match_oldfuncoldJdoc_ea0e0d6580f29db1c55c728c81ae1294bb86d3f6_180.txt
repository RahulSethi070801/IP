   * Adds a number of occurrences of an element to this multiset. Note that if {@code occurrences ==
   * 1}, this method has the identical effect to {@link #add(Object)}. This method is functionally
   * equivalent (except in the case of overflow) to the call {@code
   * addAll(Collections.nCopies(element, occurrences))}, which would presumably perform much more
   * poorly.
   *
   * @param element the element to add occurrences of; may be null only if explicitly allowed by the
   *     implementation
   * @param occurrences the number of occurrences of the element to add. May be zero, in which case
   *     no change will be made.
   * @return the count of the element before the operation; possibly zero
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code occurrences} is negative, or if this operation would
   *     result in more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} occurrences of the element
   * @throws NullPointerException if {@code element} is null and this implementation does not permit
   *     null elements. Note that if {@code occurrences} is zero, the implementation may opt to
   *     return normally.
