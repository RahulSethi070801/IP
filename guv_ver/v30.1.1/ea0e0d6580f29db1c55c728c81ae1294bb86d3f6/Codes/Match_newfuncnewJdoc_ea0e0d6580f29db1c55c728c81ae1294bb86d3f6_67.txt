   * Returns an unmodifiable view of the intersection of two multisets. In the returned multiset,
   * the count of each element is the <i>minimum</i> of its counts in the two backing multisets,
   * with elements that would have a count of 0 not included. The iteration order of the returned
   * multiset matches that of the element set of {@code multiset1}, with repeated occurrences of the
   * same element appearing consecutively.
   *
   * <p>Results are undefined if {@code multiset1} and {@code multiset2} are based on different
   * equivalence relations (as {@code HashMultiset} and {@code TreeMultiset} are).
