     * Computes the quantile values of the given dataset, performing the computation in-place.
     *
     * @param dataset the dataset to do the calculation on, which must be non-empty, and which will
     *     be arbitrarily reordered by this method call
     * @return an unmodifiable, ordered map of results: the keys will be the specified quantile
     *     indexes, and the values the corresponding quantile values. When iterating, entries in the
     *     map are ordered by quantile index in the same order that the indexes were passed to the
     *     {@code indexes} method.
