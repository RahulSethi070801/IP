     * Computes the quantile values of the given dataset.
     *
     * @param dataset the dataset to do the calculation on, which must be non-empty, which will not
     *     be mutated by this call (it is copied instead)
     * @return an unmodifiable, ordered map of results: the keys will be the specified quantile
     *     indexes, and the values the corresponding quantile values. When iterating, entries in the
     *     map are ordered by quantile index in the same order they were passed to the {@code
     *     indexes} method.
