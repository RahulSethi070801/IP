   * Divides an iterable into unmodifiable sublists of the given size, padding the final iterable
   * with null values if necessary. For example, partitioning an iterable containing {@code [a, b,
   * c, d, e]} with a partition size of 3 yields {@code [[a, b, c], [d, e, null]]} -- an outer
   * iterable containing two inner lists of three elements each, all in the original order.
   *
   * <p>Iterators returned by the returned iterable do not support the {@link Iterator#remove()}
   * method.
   *
   * @param iterable the iterable to return a partitioned view of
   * @param size the desired size of each partition
   * @return an iterable of unmodifiable lists containing the elements of {@code iterable} divided
   *     into partitions (the final iterable may have trailing null elements)
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code size} is nonpositive
