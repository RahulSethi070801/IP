   * Returns a fluent iterable that combines two iterables. The returned iterable has an iterator
   * that traverses the elements in {@code a}, followed by the elements in {@code b}. The source
   * iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding input
   * iterator supports it.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> {@link Stream#concat}.
