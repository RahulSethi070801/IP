   * Removes the element at position {@code index}.
   *
   * <p>Normally this method leaves the elements at up to {@code index - 1}, inclusive, untouched.
   * Under these circumstances, it returns {@code null}.
   *
   * <p>Occasionally, in order to maintain the heap invariant, it must swap a later element of the
   * list with one before {@code index}. Under these circumstances it returns a pair of elements as
   * a {@link MoveDesc}. The first one is the element that was previously at the end of the heap and
   * is now at some position before {@code index}. The second element is the one that was swapped
   * down to replace the element at {@code index}. This fact is used by iterator.remove so as to
   * visit elements during a traversal once and only once.
