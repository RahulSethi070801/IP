   * Returns a fluent iterable that combines three iterables. The returned iterable has an iterator
   * that traverses the elements in {@code a}, followed by the elements in {@code b}, followed by
   * the elements in {@code c}. The source iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding input
   * iterator supports it.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> use nested calls to {@link Stream#concat}, or see the
   * advice in {@link #concat(Iterable...)}.
