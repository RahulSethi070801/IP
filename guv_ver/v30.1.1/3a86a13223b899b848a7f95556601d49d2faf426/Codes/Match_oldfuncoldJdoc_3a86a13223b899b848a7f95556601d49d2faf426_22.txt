   * Returns a fluent iterable that combines several iterables. The returned iterable has an
   * iterator that traverses the elements of each iterable in {@code inputs}. The input iterators
   * are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding input
   * iterator supports it. The methods of the returned iterable may throw {@code
   * NullPointerException} if any of the input iterators is {@code null}.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> {@code streamOfStreams.flatMap(s -> s)} or {@code
   * streamOfIterables.flatMap(Streams::stream)}. (See {@link Streams#stream}.)
