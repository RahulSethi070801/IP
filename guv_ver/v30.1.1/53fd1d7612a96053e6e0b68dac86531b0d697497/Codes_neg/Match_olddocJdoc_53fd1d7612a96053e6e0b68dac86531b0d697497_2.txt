   * Coerces an IPv6 address into an IPv4 address.
   *
   * <p>HACK: As long as applications continue to use IPv4 addresses for indexing into tables,
   * accounting, et cetera, it may be necessary to <b>coerce</b> IPv6 addresses into IPv4 addresses.
   * This function does so by hashing 64 bits of the IPv6 address into {@code 224.0.0.0/3} (64 bits
   * into 29 bits):
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If the IPv6 address contains an embedded IPv4 address, the function hashes that.
   *   <li>Otherwise, it hashes the upper 64 bits of the IPv6 address.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>A "coerced" IPv4 address is equivalent to itself.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: This function is failsafe for security purposes: ALL IPv6 addresses (except localhost
   * (::1)) are hashed to avoid the security risk associated with extracting an embedded IPv4
   * address that might permit elevated privileges.
   *
   * @param ip {@link InetAddress} to "coerce"
