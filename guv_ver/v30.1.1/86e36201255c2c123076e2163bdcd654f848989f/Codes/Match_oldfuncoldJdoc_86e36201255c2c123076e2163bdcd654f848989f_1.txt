   * Registers a {@link Listener} to be run when this {@link ServiceManager} changes state. The
   * listener will not have previous state changes replayed, so it is suggested that listeners are
   * added before any of the managed services are {@linkplain Service#startAsync started}.
   *
   * <p>{@code addListener} guarantees execution ordering across calls to a given listener but not
   * across calls to multiple listeners. Specifically, a given listener will have its callbacks
   * invoked in the same order as the underlying service enters those states. Additionally, at most
   * one of the listener's callbacks will execute at once. However, multiple listeners' callbacks
   * may execute concurrently, and listeners may execute in an order different from the one in which
   * they were registered.
   *
   * <p>RuntimeExceptions thrown by a listener will be caught and logged.
   *
   * @param listener the listener to run when the manager changes state
