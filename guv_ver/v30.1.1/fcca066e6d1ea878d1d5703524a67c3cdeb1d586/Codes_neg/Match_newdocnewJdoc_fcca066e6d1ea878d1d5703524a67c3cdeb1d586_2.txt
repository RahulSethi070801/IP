   * Specifies a listener instance that caches should notify each time an entry is removed for any
   * {@linkplain RemovalCause reason}. Each cache created by this builder will invoke this listener
   * as part of the routine maintenance described in the class documentation above.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> after invoking this method, do not continue to use <i>this</i> cache builder
   * reference; instead use the reference this method <i>returns</i>. At runtime, these point to the
   * same instance, but only the returned reference has the correct generic type information to
   * ensure type safety. For best results, use the standard method-chaining idiom illustrated in the
   * class documentation above, configuring a builder and building your cache in a single statement.
   * Failure to heed this advice can result in a {@link ClassCastException} being thrown by a cache
   * operation at some <i>undefined</i> point in the future.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> any exception thrown by {@code listener} will <i>not</i> be propagated to
   * the {@code Cache} user, only logged via a {@link Logger}.
   *
   * @return the cache builder reference that should be used instead of {@code this} for any
   *     remaining configuration and cache building
   * @return this {@code CacheBuilder} instance (for chaining)
   * @throws IllegalStateException if a removal listener was already set
