   * Splits {@code sequence} into string components and makes them available through an {@link
   * Iterator}, which may be lazily evaluated. If you want an eagerly computed {@link List}, use
   * {@link #splitToList(CharSequence)}. Java 8 users may prefer {@link #splitToStream} instead.
   *
   * @param sequence the sequence of characters to split
   * @return an iteration over the segments split from the parameter
