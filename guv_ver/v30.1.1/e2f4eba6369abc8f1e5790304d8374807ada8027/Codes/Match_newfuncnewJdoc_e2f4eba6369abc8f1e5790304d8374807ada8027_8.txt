   * Returns statistics over a dataset containing the given values. The stream will be completely
   * consumed by this method.
   *
   * <p>If you have a {@code Stream<Long>} rather than a {@code LongStream}, you should collect the
   * values using {@link #toStats()} instead.
   *
   * @param values a series of values, which will be converted to {@code double} values (this may
   *     cause loss of precision for longs of magnitude over 2^53 (slightly over 9e15))
