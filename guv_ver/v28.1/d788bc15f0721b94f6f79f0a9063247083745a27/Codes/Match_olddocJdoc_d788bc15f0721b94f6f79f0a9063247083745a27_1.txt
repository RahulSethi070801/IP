   * Returns the count of {@code node}'s incident edges, counting self-loops twice (equivalently,
   * the number of times an edge touches {@code node}).
   *
   * <p>For directed graphs, this is equal to {@code inDegree(node) + outDegree(node)}.
   *
   * <p>For undirected graphs, this is equal to {@code adjacentNodes(node).size()} + (1 if {@code
   * node} has an incident self-loop, 0 otherwise).
   *
   * <p>If the count is greater than {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}, returns {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code node} is not an element of this graph
