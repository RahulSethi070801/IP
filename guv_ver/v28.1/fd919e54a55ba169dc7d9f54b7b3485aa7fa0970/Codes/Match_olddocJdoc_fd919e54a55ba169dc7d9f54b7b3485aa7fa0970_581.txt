   * Determines whether a character is whitespace according to the latest Unicode standard, as
   * illustrated
   * <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5Cp%7Bwhitespace%7D">here</a>.
   * This is not the same definition used by other Java APIs. (See a
   * <a href="https://goo.gl/Y6SLWx">comparison of several definitions of
   * "whitespace"</a>.)
   *
   * <p>All Unicode White_Space characters are on the BMP and thus supported by this API.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> as the Unicode definition evolves, we will modify this matcher to keep it up to
   * date.

   * @since 19.0 (since 1.0 as constant {@code WHITESPACE})
