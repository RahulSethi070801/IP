     * {@code [<E>]} will be returned for ArrayList's constructor. When both the class and the
     * constructor have type parameters, the class parameters are prepended before those of the
     * constructor's. This is an arbitrary rule since no existing language spec mandates one way or
     * the other. From the declaration syntax, the class type parameter appears first, but the call
     * syntax may show up in opposite order such as {@code new <A>Foo<B>()}.
