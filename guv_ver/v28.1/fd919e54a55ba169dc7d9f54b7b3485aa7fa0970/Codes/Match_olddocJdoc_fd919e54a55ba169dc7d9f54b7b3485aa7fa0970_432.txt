   * Returns a string copy of the input character sequence, with each matching BMP character
   * replaced by a given replacement character. For example: <pre>   {@code
   *
   *   CharMatcher.is('a').replaceFrom("radar", 'o')}</pre>
   *
   * ... returns {@code "rodor"}.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation uses {@link #indexIn(CharSequence)} to find the first matching
   * character, then iterates the remainder of the sequence calling {@link #matches(char)} for each
   * character.
   *
   * @param sequence the character sequence to replace matching characters in
   * @param replacement the character to append to the result string in place of each matching
   *     character in {@code sequence}
   * @return the new string
