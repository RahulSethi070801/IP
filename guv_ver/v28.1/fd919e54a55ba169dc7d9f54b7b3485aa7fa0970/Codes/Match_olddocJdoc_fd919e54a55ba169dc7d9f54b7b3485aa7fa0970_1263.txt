   * Returns a string copy of the input character sequence, with each group of consecutive
   * matching BMP characters replaced by a single replacement character. For example:
   * <pre>   {@code
   *
   *   CharMatcher.anyOf("eko").collapseFrom("bookkeeper", '-')}</pre>
   *
   * ... returns {@code "b-p-r"}.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation uses {@link #indexIn(CharSequence)} to find the first matching
   * character, then iterates the remainder of the sequence calling {@link #matches(char)} for each
   * character.
   *
   * @param sequence the character sequence to replace matching groups of characters in
   * @param replacement the character to append to the result string in place of each group of
   *     matching characters in {@code sequence}
   * @return the new string
