   * Returns {@code true} if a character sequence contains no matching BMP characters. Equivalent to
   * {@code !matchesAnyOf(sequence)}.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation iterates over the sequence, invoking {@link #matches} for each
   * character, until this returns {@code true} or the end is reached.
   *
   * @param sequence the character sequence to examine, possibly empty
   * @return {@code true} if this matcher matches no characters in the sequence, including when
   *     the sequence is empty
