   * Opens a new buffered {@link InputStream} for reading from this source. The returned stream is
   * not required to be a {@link BufferedInputStream} in order to allow implementations to simply
   * delegate to {@link #openStream()} when the stream returned by that method does not benefit from
   * additional buffering (for example, a {@code ByteArrayInputStream}). This method returns a
   * new, independent stream each time it is called.
   *
   * <p>The caller is responsible for ensuring that the returned stream is closed.
   *
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while opening the stream
   * @since 15.0 (in 14.0 with return type {@link BufferedInputStream})
