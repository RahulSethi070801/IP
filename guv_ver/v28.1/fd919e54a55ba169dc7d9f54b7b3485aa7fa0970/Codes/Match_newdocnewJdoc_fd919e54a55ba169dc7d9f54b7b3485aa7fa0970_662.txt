   * Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes special characters in a string so it can
   * safely be included in an XML document as element content. See section <a
   * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#syntax">2.4</a> of the XML specification.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> Double and single quotes are not escaped, so it is <b>not safe</b> to use this
   * escaper to escape attribute values. Use {@link #xmlContentEscaper} if the output can appear in
   * element content or {@link #xmlAttributeEscaper} in attribute values.
   *
   * <p>This escaper substitutes {@code 0xFFFD} for non-whitespace control characters and the
   * character values {@code 0xFFFE} and {@code 0xFFFF} which are not permitted in XML. For more
   * detail see section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#charsets">2.2</a> of
   * the XML specification.
   *
   * <p>This escaper does not escape non-ASCII characters to their numeric character references
   * (NCR). Any non-ASCII characters appearing in the input will be preserved in the output.
   * Specifically "\r" (carriage return) is preserved in the output, which may result in it being
   * silently converted to "\n" when the XML is parsed.
   *
   * <p>This escaper does not treat surrogate pairs specially and does not perform Unicode
   * validation on its input.
