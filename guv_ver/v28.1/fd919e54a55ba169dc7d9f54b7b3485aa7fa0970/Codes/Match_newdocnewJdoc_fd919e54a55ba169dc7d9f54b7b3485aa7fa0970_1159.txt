   * Returns the hash code for this multiset. This is defined as the sum of
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * ((element == null) ? 0 : element.hashCode()) ^ count(element)
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>over all distinct elements in the multiset. It follows that a multiset and its entry set
   * always have the same hash code.
