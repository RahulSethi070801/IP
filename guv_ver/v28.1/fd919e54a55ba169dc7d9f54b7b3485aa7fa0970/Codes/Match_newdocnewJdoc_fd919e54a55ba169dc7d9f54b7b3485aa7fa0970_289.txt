   * Evaluates whether the argument is an IPv6 "compat" address.
   *
   * <p>An "IPv4 compatible", or "compat", address is one with 96 leading bits of zero, with the
   * remaining 32 bits interpreted as an IPv4 address. These are conventionally represented in
   * string literals as {@code "::192.168.0.1"}, though {@code "::c0a8:1"} is also considered an
   * IPv4 compatible address (and equivalent to {@code "::192.168.0.1"}).
   *
   * <p>For more on IPv4 compatible addresses see section 2.5.5.1 of <a target="_parent"
   * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.1">RFC 4291</a>.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: This method is different from {@link Inet6Address#isIPv4CompatibleAddress} in that it
   * more correctly classifies {@code "::"} and {@code "::1"} as proper IPv6 addresses (which they
   * are), NOT IPv4 compatible addresses (which they are generally NOT considered to be).
   *
   * @param ip {@link Inet6Address} to be examined for embedded IPv4 compatible address format
   * @return {@code true} if the argument is a valid "compat" address
