   * Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes HTML metacharacters as specified by
   * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">HTML 4.01</a>. The resulting strings can be used both in
   * attribute values and in <em>most</em> elements' text contents, provided that the HTML
   * document's character encoding can encode any non-ASCII code points in the input (as UTF-8 and
   * other Unicode encodings can).
   *
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> This escaper only performs minimal escaping to make content structurally
   * compatible with HTML. Specifically, it does not perform entity replacement (symbolic or
   * numeric), so it does not replace non-ASCII code points with character references. This escaper
   * escapes only the following five ASCII characters: {@code '"&<>}.
