   * Returns a string copy of the input character sequence, with each matching BMP character
   * replaced by a given replacement sequence. For example: <pre>   {@code
   *
   *   CharMatcher.is('a').replaceFrom("yaha", "oo")}</pre>
   *
   * ... returns {@code "yoohoo"}.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> If the replacement is a fixed string with only one character, you are better
   * off calling {@link #replaceFrom(CharSequence, char)} directly.
   *
   * @param sequence the character sequence to replace matching characters in
   * @param replacement the characters to append to the result string in place of each matching
   *     character in {@code sequence}
   * @return the new string
