   * Returns the string representation of an {@link InetAddress} suitable for inclusion in a URI.
   *
   * <p>For IPv4 addresses, this is identical to {@link InetAddress#getHostAddress()}, but for IPv6
   * addresses it compresses zeroes and surrounds the text with square brackets; for example {@code
   * "[2001:db8::1]"}.
   *
   * <p>Per section 3.2.2 of <a target="_parent"
   * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2">RFC 3986</a>, a URI containing an IPv6
   * string literal is of the form {@code "http://[2001:db8::1]:8888/index.html"}.
   *
   * <p>Use of either {@link InetAddresses#toAddrString}, {@link InetAddress#getHostAddress()}, or
   * this method is recommended over {@link InetAddress#toString()} when an IP address string
   * literal is desired. This is because {@link InetAddress#toString()} prints the hostname and the
   * IP address string joined by a "/".
   *
   * @param ip {@link InetAddress} to be converted to URI string literal
   * @return {@code String} containing URI-safe string literal
