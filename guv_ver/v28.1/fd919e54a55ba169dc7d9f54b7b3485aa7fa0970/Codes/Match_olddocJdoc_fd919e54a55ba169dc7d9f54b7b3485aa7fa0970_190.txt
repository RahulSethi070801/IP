   * Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes special characters in a string so it can
   * safely be included in XML document as an attribute value. See section
   * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#AVNormalize">3.3.3</a> of the XML
   * specification.
   *
   * <p>This escaper substitutes {@code 0xFFFD} for non-whitespace control characters and the
   * character values {@code 0xFFFE} and {@code 0xFFFF} which are not permitted in XML. For more
   * detail see section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#charsets">2.2</a> of
   * the XML specification.
   *
   * <p>This escaper does not escape non-ASCII characters to their numeric character references
   * (NCR). However, horizontal tab {@code '\t'}, line feed {@code '\n'} and carriage return
   * {@code '\r'} are escaped to a corresponding NCR {@code "&#x9;"}, {@code "&#xA;"}, and
   * {@code "&#xD;"} respectively. Any other non-ASCII characters appearing in the input will be
   * preserved in the output.
   *
   * <p>This escaper does not treat surrogate pairs specially and does not perform Unicode
   * validation on its input.
