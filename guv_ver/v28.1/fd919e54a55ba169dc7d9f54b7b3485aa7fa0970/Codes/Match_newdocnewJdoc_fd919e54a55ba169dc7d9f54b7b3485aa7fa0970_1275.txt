   * Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes strings so they can be safely included in a <a
   * href="https://goo.gl/xXEq4p">URL fragment</a>. The returned escaper escapes all non-ASCII
   * characters, even though <a href="https://goo.gl/e7E0In">many of these are accepted in modern
   * URLs</a>.
   *
   * <p>When escaping a String, the following rules apply:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain
   *       the same.
   *   <li>The unreserved characters ".", "-", "~", and "_" remain the same.
   *   <li>The general delimiters "@" and ":" remain the same.
   *   <li>The subdelimiters "!", "$", "&amp;", "'", "(", ")", "*", "+", ",", ";", and "=" remain
   *       the same.
   *   <li>The space character " " is converted into %20.
   *   <li>Fragments allow unescaped "/" and "?", so they remain the same.
   *   <li>All other characters are converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding and each
   *       byte is then represented by the 3-character string "%XY", where "XY" is the two-digit,
   *       uppercase, hexadecimal representation of the byte value.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> Unlike other escapers, URL escapers produce <a
   * href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode">uppercase</a> hexadecimal sequences.
