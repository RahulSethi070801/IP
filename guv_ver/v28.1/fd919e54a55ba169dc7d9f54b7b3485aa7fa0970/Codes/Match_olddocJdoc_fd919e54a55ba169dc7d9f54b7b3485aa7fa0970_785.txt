   * Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes strings so they can be safely included in
   * <a href="https://goo.gl/MplK6I">URL form parameter names and values</a>. Escaping is performed
   * with the UTF-8 character encoding. The caller is responsible for
   * <a href="https://goo.gl/9EfkM1">replacing any unpaired carriage return or line feed characters
   * with a CR+LF pair</a> on any non-file inputs before escaping them with this escaper.
   *
   * <p>When escaping a String, the following rules apply:
   * <ul>
   * <li>The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain the
   *     same.
   * <li>The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
   * <li>The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+".
   * <li>All other characters are converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding and each
   *     byte is then represented by the 3-character string "%XY", where "XY" is the two-digit,
   *     uppercase, hexadecimal representation of the byte value.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This escaper is suitable for escaping parameter names and values even when
   * <a href="https://goo.gl/utn6M">using the non-standard semicolon</a>, rather than the ampersand,
   * as a parameter delimiter. Nevertheless, we recommend using the ampersand unless you must
   * interoperate with systems that require semicolons.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> Unlike other escapers, URL escapers produce <a
   * href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode">uppercase</a> hexadecimal sequences.
