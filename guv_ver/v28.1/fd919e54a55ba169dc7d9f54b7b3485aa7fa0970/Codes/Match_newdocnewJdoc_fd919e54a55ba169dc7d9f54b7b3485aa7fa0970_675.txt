   * Evaluates whether the argument is an "IPv4 mapped" IPv6 address.
   *
   * <p>An "IPv4 mapped" address is anything in the range ::ffff:0:0/96 (sometimes written as
   * ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96), with the last 32 bits interpreted as an IPv4 address.
   *
   * <p>For more on IPv4 mapped addresses see section 2.5.5.2 of <a target="_parent"
   * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.2">RFC 4291</a>.
   *
   * <p>Note: This method takes a {@code String} argument because {@link InetAddress} automatically
   * collapses mapped addresses to IPv4. (It is actually possible to avoid this using one of the
   * obscure {@link Inet6Address} methods, but it would be unwise to depend on such a
   * poorly-documented feature.)
   *
   * @param ipString {@code String} to be examined for embedded IPv4-mapped IPv6 address format
   * @return {@code true} if the argument is a valid "mapped" address
