   * Returns the <a
   * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Corrected_sample_standard_deviation">
   * corrected sample standard deviation</a> of the values. If this dataset is a sample drawn from a
   * population, this is an estimator of the population standard deviation of the population which
   * is less biased than {@link #populationStandardDeviation()} (the unbiased estimator depends on
   * the distribution). The count must be greater than one.
   *
   * <p>This is not guaranteed to return zero when the dataset consists of the same value multiple
   * times, due to numerical errors. However, it is guaranteed never to return a negative result.
   *
   * <h3>Non-finite values</h3>
   *
   * <p>If the dataset contains any non-finite values ({@link Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY}, {@link
   * Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY}, or {@link Double#NaN}) then the result is {@link Double#NaN}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalStateException if the dataset is empty or contains a single value
