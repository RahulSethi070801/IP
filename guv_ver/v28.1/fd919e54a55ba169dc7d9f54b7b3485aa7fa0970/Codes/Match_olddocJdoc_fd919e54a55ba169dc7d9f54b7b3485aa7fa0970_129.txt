   * Returns a linear transformation giving the best fit to the data according to
   * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html">Ordinary Least Squares linear
   * regression</a> of {@code y} as a function of {@code x}. The count must be greater than one, and
   * either the {@code x} or {@code y} data must have a non-zero population variance (i.e.
   * {@code xStats().populationVariance() > 0.0 || yStats().populationVariance() > 0.0}). The result
   * is guaranteed to be horizontal if there is variance in the {@code x} data but not the {@code y}
   * data, and vertical if there is variance in the {@code y} data but not the {@code x} data.
   *
   * <p>This fit minimizes the root-mean-square error in {@code y} as a function of {@code x}. This
   * error is defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between the
   * actual {@code y} values of the data and the values predicted by the fit for the {@code x}
   * values (i.e. it is the square root of the mean of the squares of the vertical distances between
   * the data points and the best fit line). For this fit, this error is a fraction
   * {@code sqrt(1 - R*R)} of the population standard deviation of {@code y}, where {@code R} is the
   * Pearson's correlation coefficient (as given by {@link #pearsonsCorrelationCoefficient()}).
   *
   * <p>The corresponding root-mean-square error in {@code x} as a function of {@code y} is a
   * fraction {@code sqrt(1/(R*R) - 1)} of the population standard deviation of {@code x}. This fit
   * does not normally minimize that error: to do that, you should swap the roles of {@code x} and
   * {@code y}.
   *
   * <h3>Non-finite values</h3>
   *
   * <p>If the dataset contains any non-finite values ({@link Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY},
   * {@link Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY}, or {@link Double#NaN}) then the result is
   * {@link LinearTransformation#forNaN()}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalStateException if the dataset is empty or contains a single pair of values, or
   *     both the {@code x} and {@code y} dataset have zero population variance
