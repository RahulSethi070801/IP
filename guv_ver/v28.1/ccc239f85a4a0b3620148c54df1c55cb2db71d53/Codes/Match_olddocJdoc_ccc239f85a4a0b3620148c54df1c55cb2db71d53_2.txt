   * Uses a {@link LinkedHashMap} to map keys to value collections.
   *
   * <p>The collections returned by {@link Multimap#keySet()}, {@link Multimap#keys()}, and {@link
   * Multimap#asMap()} will iterate through the keys in the order that they were first added to the
   * multimap, save that if all values associated with a key are removed and then the key is added
   * back into the multimap, that key will come last in the key iteration order.
