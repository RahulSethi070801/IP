   * Returns a {@link Traverser} instance for the file and directory tree. The returned traverser
   * starts from a {@link File} and will return all files and directories it encounters.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> {@code File} provides no support for symbolic links, and as such there is no
   * way to ensure that a symbolic link to a directory is not followed when traversing the tree. In
   * this case, iterables created by this traverser could contain files that are outside of the
   * given directory or even be infinite if there is a symbolic link loop.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link File} passed to one of the {@link Traverser} methods does not exist or is not
   * a directory, no exception will be thrown and the returned {@link Iterable} will contain a
   * single element: that file.
   *
   * <p>Example: {@code Files.fileTraverser().breadthFirst("/")} may return files with the following
   * paths: {@code ["/", "/etc", "/home", "/usr", "/etc/config.txt", "/etc/fonts", ...]}
