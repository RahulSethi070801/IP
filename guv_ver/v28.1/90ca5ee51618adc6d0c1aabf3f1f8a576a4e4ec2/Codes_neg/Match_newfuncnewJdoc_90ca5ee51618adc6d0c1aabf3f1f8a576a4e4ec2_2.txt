   * Returns a {@link Traverser} instance for the file and directory tree. The returned traverser
   * starts from a {@link Path} and will return all files and directories it encounters.
   *
   * <p>The returned traverser attempts to avoid following symbolic links to directories. However,
   * the traverser cannot guarantee that it will not follow symbolic links to directories as it is
   * possible for a directory to be replaced with a symbolic link between checking if the file is a
   * directory and actually reading the contents of that directory.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link Path} passed to one of the traversal methods does not exist or is not a
   * directory, no exception will be thrown and the returned {@link Iterable} will contain a single
   * element: that path.
   *
   * <p>{@link DirectoryIteratorException} may be thrown when iterating {@link Iterable} instances
   * created by this traverser if an {@link IOException} is thrown by a call to {@link
   * #listFiles(Path)}.
   *
   * <p>Example: {@code MoreFiles.fileTraverser().breadhFirst("/")} may return files with the
   * following paths: {@code ["/", "/etc", "/home", "/usr", "/etc/config.txt", "/etc/fonts", ...]}
