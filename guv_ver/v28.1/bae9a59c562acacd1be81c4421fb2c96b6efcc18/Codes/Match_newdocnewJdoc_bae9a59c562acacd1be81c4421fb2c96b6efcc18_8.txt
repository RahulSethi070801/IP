   * Returns an immutable bimap containing the same entries as {@code map}. If
   * {@code map} somehow contains entries with duplicate keys (for example, if
   * it is a {@code SortedMap} whose comparator is not <i>consistent with
   * equals</i>), the results of this method are undefined.
   *
   * <p>The returned {@code BiMap} iterates over entries in the same order as the
   * {@code entrySet} of the original map.
   *
   * <p>Despite the method name, this method attempts to avoid actually copying
   * the data when it is safe to do so. The exact circumstances under which a
   * copy will or will not be performed are undocumented and subject to change.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if two keys have the same value or two values have the same
   *     key
   * @throws NullPointerException if any key or value in {@code map} is null
