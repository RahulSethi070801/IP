   * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates the input elements into a new
   * {@code ImmutableSet}.  Elements are added in encounter order; if the
   * elements contain duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}),
   * only the first duplicate in encounter order will appear in the result.
