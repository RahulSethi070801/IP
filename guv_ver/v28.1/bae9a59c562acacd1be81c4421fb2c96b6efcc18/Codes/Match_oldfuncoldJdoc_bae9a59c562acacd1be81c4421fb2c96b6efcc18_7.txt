   * Returns an immutable map containing the same entries as {@code map}. If {@code map} somehow
   * contains entries with duplicate keys (for example, if it is a {@code SortedMap} whose
   * comparator is not <i>consistent with equals</i>), the results of this method are undefined.
   *
   * <p>Despite the method name, this method attempts to avoid actually copying the data when it is
   * safe to do so. The exact circumstances under which a copy will or will not be performed are
   * undocumented and subject to change.
   *
   * @throws NullPointerException if any key or value in {@code map} is null
