   * Returns a view of this multimap as a {@code Map} from each distinct key
   * to the nonempty collection of that key's associated values. Note that
   * {@code this.asMap().get(k)} is equivalent to {@code this.get(k)} only when
   * {@code k} is a key contained in the multimap; otherwise it returns {@code
   * null} as opposed to an empty collection.
   *
   * <p>Changes to the returned map or the collections that serve as its values
   * will update the underlying multimap, and vice versa. The map does not
   * support {@code put} or {@code putAll}, nor do its entries support {@link
   * Entry#setValue setValue}.
