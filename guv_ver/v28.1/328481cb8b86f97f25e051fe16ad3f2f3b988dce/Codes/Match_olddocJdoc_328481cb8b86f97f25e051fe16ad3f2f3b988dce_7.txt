   * Implements {@code Collection.remove} safely for forwarding collections of
   * map entries. If {@code o} is an instance of {@code Map.Entry}, it is
   * wrapped using {@link #unmodifiableEntry} to protect against a possible
   * nefarious equals method.
   *
   * <p>Note that {@code c} is backing (delegate) collection, rather than the
   * forwarding collection.
   *
   * @param c the delegate (unwrapped) collection of map entries
   * @param o the object to remove from {@code c}
   * @return {@code true} if {@code c} was changed
