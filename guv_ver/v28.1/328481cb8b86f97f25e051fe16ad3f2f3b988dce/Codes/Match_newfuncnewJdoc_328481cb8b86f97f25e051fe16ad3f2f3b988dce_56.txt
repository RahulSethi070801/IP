     * Performs a depth-first traversal of the graph edges defined by each node's
     * {@code allowedPriorLocks} to find a path between {@code this} and the specified {@code lock}.
     *
     * @return If a path was found, a chained {@link ExampleStackTrace} illustrating the path to the
     *     {@code lock}, or {@code null} if no path was found.
