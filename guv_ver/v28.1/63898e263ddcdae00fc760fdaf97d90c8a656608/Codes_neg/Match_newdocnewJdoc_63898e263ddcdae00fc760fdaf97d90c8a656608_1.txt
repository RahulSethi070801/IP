   * Returns a {@code ClassPath} representing all classes and resources loadable from {@code
   * classloader} and its ancestor class loaders.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> {@code ClassPath} can find classes and resources only from:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@link URLClassLoader} instances' {@code file:} URLs
   *   <li>the {@linkplain ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader}. To search the
   *       system class loader even when it is not a {@link URLClassLoader} (as in Java 9), {@code
   *       ClassPath} searches the files from the {@code java.class.path} system property.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @throws IOException if the attempt to read class path resources (jar files or directories)
   *     failed.
