   * Returns a {@code Collector} expecting the specified number of insertions, and yielding a {@link
   * BloomFilter} with the specified expected false positive probability.
   *
   * <p>Note that if the {@code Collector} receives significantly more elements than specified, the
   * resulting {@code BloomFilter} will suffer a sharp deterioration of its false positive
   * probability.
   *
   * <p>The constructed {@code BloomFilter} will be serializable if the provided {@code
   * Funnel<T>} is.
   *
   * <p>It is recommended that the funnel be implemented as a Java enum. This has the benefit of
   * ensuring proper serialization and deserialization, which is important since {@link #equals}
   * also relies on object identity of funnels.
   *
   * @param funnel the funnel of T's that the constructed {@code BloomFilter} will use
   * @param expectedInsertions the number of expected insertions to the constructed {@code
   *     BloomFilter}; must be positive
   * @param fpp the desired false positive probability (must be positive and less than 1.0)
   * @return a {@code Collector} generating a {@code BloomFilter} of the received elements
   * @since 23.0
