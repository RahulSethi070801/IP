   * Creates a {@link BloomFilter} with the expected number of insertions and a
   * default expected false positive probability of 3%.
   *
   * <p>Note that overflowing a {@code BloomFilter} with significantly more elements than specified,
   * will result in its saturation, and a sharp deterioration of its false positive probability.
   *
   * <p>The constructed {@code BloomFilter} will be serializable if the provided
   * {@code Funnel<T>} is.
   *
   * <p>It is recommended that the funnel be implemented as a Java enum. This has the benefit of
   * ensuring proper serialization and deserialization, which is important since {@link #equals}
   * also relies on object identity of funnels.
   *
   * @param funnel the funnel of T's that the constructed {@code BloomFilter} will use
   * @param expectedInsertions the number of expected insertions to the constructed
   *     {@code BloomFilter}; must be positive
   * @return a {@code BloomFilter}
   * @since 19.0
