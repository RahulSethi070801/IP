   * This method should be used to initiate service shutdown. The invocation of this method should
   * cause a call to {@link #notifyStopped()}, either during this method's run, or after it has
   * returned. If shutdown fails, the invocation should cause a call to {@link
   * #notifyFailed(Throwable)} instead.
   *
   * <p>This method should return promptly; prefer to do work on a different thread where it is
   * convenient. It is invoked exactly once on service shutdown, even when {@link #stopAsync} is
   * called multiple times.
   *
   * <p>If {@link #stopAsync} is called on a {@link State#STARTING} service, this method is not
   * invoked immediately. Instead, it will be deferred until after the service is {@link
   * State#RUNNING}. Services that need to cancel startup work can override {#link #doCancelStart}.
