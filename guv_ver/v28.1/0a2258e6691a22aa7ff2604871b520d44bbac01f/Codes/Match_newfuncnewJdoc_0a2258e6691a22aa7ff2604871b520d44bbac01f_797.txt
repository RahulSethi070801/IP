     * Determines an output value based on a key-value pair. This method is <i>generally
     * expected</i>, but not absolutely required, to have the following properties:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Its execution does not cause any observable side effects.
     *   <li>The computation is <i>consistent with equals</i>; that is, {@link Objects#equal
     *       Objects.equal}{@code (k1, k2) &&} {@link Objects#equal}{@code (v1, v2)} implies that
     *       {@code Objects.equal(transformer.transform(k1, v1), transformer.transform(k2, v2))}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @throws NullPointerException if the key or value is null and this transformer does not accept
     *     null arguments
