   * Returns a hash code for {@code t}.
   *
   * <p>The {@code hash} has the following properties:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any reference {@code x}, multiple invocations of {@code
   *       hash(x}} consistently return the same value provided {@code x} remains unchanged
   *       according to the definition of the equivalence. The hash need not remain consistent from
   *       one execution of an application to another execution of the same application.
   *   <li>It is <i>distributable across equivalence</i>: for any references {@code x} and {@code
   *       y}, if {@code equivalent(x, y)}, then {@code hash(x) == hash(y)}. It is <i>not</i>
   *       necessary that the hash be distributable across <i>inequivalence</i>. If {@code
   *       equivalence(x, y)} is false, {@code hash(x) == hash(y)} may still be true.
   *   <li>{@code hash(null)} is {@code 0}.
   * </ul>
