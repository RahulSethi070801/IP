   * Returns the lesser of the two values according to this ordering. If the values compare as 0,
   * the first is returned.
   *
   * <p><b>Implementation note:</b> this method is invoked by the default implementations of the
   * other {@code min} overloads, so overriding it will affect their behavior.
   *
   * <p><b>Java 8 users:</b> Use {@code Collections.min(Arrays.asList(a, b), thisComparator)}
   * instead (but note that it does not guarantee which tied minimum element is returned).
   *
   * @param a value to compare, returned if less than or equal to b.
   * @param b value to compare.
   * @throws ClassCastException if the parameters are not <i>mutually comparable</i> under this
   *     ordering.
