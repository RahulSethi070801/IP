   * Searches the specified list for the specified object using the binary search algorithm. The
   * list must be sorted into ascending order according to the specified comparator (as by the
   * {@link Collections#sort(List, Comparator) Collections.sort(List, Comparator)} method), prior to
   * making this call. If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.
   *
   * <p>If there are elements in the list which compare as equal to the key, the choice of {@link
   * KeyPresentBehavior} decides which index is returned. If no elements compare as equal to the
   * key, the choice of {@link KeyAbsentBehavior} decides which index is returned.
   *
   * <p>This method runs in log(n) time on random-access lists, which offer near-constant-time
   * access to each list element.
   *
   * @param list the list to be searched.
   * @param key the value to be searched for.
   * @param comparator the comparator by which the list is ordered.
   * @param presentBehavior the specification for what to do if at least one element of the list
   *     compares as equal to the key.
   * @param absentBehavior the specification for what to do if no elements of the list compare as
   *     equal to the key.
   * @return the index determined by the {@code KeyPresentBehavior}, if the key is in the list;
   *     otherwise the index determined by the {@code KeyAbsentBehavior}.
