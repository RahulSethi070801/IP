   * Returns the first element in {@code iterator} that satisfies the given predicate. If no such
   * element is found, {@code defaultValue} will be returned from this method and the iterator will
   * be left exhausted: its {@code hasNext()} method will return {@code false}. Note that this can
   * usually be handled more naturally using {@code tryFind(iterator, predicate).or(defaultValue)}.
