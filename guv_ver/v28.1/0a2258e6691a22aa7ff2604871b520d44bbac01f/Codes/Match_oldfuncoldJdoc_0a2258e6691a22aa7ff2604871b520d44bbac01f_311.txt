   * Propagates {@code throwable} exactly as-is, if and only if it is an instance of {@link
   * RuntimeException}, {@link Error}, {@code declaredType1}, or {@code declaredType2}. In the
   * unlikely case that you have three or more declared checked exception types, you can handle them
   * all by invoking these methods repeatedly. See usage example in {@link
   * #propagateIfPossible(Throwable, Class)}.
   *
   * @param throwable the Throwable to possibly propagate
   * @param declaredType1 any checked exception type declared by the calling method
   * @param declaredType2 any other checked exception type declared by the calling method
