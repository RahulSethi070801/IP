   * Returns an unmodifiable {@code Iterable} over the nodes reachable from {@code startNode}, in
   * the order of a depth-first pre-order traversal. "Pre-order" implies that nodes appear in the
   * {@code Iterable} in the order in which they are first visited.
   *
   * <p><b>Example:</b> The following graph with {@code startNode} {@code a} would return nodes in
   * the order {@code abecfd} (assuming successors are returned in alphabetical order).
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * b ---- a ---- d
   * |      |
   * |      |
   * e ---- c ---- f
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>The behavior of this method is undefined if the nodes, or the topology of the graph, change
   * while iteration is in progress.
   *
   * <p>The returned {@code Iterable} can be iterated over multiple times. Every iterator will
   * compute its next element on the fly. It is thus possible to limit the traversal to a certain
   * number of nodes as follows:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Iterables.limit(
   *     Traverser.forGraph(graph).depthFirstPreOrder(node), maxNumberOfNodes);
   * }</pre>
