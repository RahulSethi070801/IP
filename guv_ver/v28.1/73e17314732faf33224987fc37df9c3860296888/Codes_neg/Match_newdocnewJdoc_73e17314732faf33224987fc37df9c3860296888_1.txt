   * Sets the result of this {@code Future} to match the supplied input {@code Future} once the
   * supplied {@code Future} is done, unless this {@code Future} has already been cancelled or set
   * (including "set asynchronously," defined below).
   *
   * <p>If the supplied future is {@linkplain #isDone done} when this method is called and the call
   * is accepted, then this future is guaranteed to have been completed with the supplied future by
   * the time this method returns. If the supplied future is not done and the call is accepted, then
   * the future will be <i>set asynchronously</i>. Note that such a result, though not yet known,
   * cannot be overridden by a call to a {@code set*} method, only by a call to {@link #cancel}.
   *
   * <p>If the call {@code setFuture(delegate)} is accepted and this {@code Future} is later
   * cancelled, cancellation will be propagated to {@code delegate}. Additionally, any call to
   * {@code setFuture} after any cancellation will propagate cancellation to the supplied {@code
   * Future}.
   *
   * <p>Note that, even if the supplied future is cancelled and it causes this future to complete,
   * it will never trigger interruption behavior. In particular, it will not cause this future to
   * invoke the {@link #interruptTask} method, and the {@link #wasInterrupted} method will not
   * return {@code true}.
   *
   * @param future the future to delegate to
   * @return true if the attempt was accepted, indicating that the {@code Future} was not previously
   *     cancelled or set.
   * @since 19.0
