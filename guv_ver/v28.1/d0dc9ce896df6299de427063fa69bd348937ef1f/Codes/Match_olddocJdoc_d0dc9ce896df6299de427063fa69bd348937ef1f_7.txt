   * For the default {@link Network} implementations, returns true if {@code this == object}
   * (reference equality). External implementations are free to define this method as they see fit,
   * as long as they satisfy the {@link Object#equals(Object)} contract.
   *
   * <p>To compare two {@link Network}s based on their contents rather than their references, see
   * {@link Graphs#equivalent(Network, Network)}.
