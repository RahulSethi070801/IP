   * Returns the current elapsed time shown on this stopwatch, expressed in the desired time unit,
   * with any fraction rounded down.
   *
   * <p>Note that the overhead of measurement can be more than a microsecond, so it is generally not
   * useful to specify {@link TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} precision here.
   *
   * @since 14.0 (since 10.0 as {@code elapsedTime()})
