   * Creates a new traverser for a directed acyclic graph that has at most one path from the start
   * node(s) to any node reachable from the start node(s), and has no paths from any start node to
   * any other start node, such as a tree or forest.
   *
   * <p>{@code forTree()} is especially useful (versus {@code forGraph()}) in cases where the data
   * structure being traversed is, in addition to being a tree/forest, also defined <a
   * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#non-recursiveness">recursively</a>.
   * This is because the {@code forTree()}-based implementations don't keep track of visited nodes,
   * and therefore don't need to call `equals()` or `hashCode()` on the node objects; this saves
   * both time and space versus traversing the same graph using {@code forGraph()}.
   *
   * <p>Providing a graph to be traversed for which there is more than one path from the start
   * node(s) to any node may lead to:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Traversal not terminating (if the graph has cycles)
   *   <li>Nodes being visited multiple times (if multiple paths exist from any start node to any
   *       node reachable from any start node)
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Performance notes</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Traversals require <i>O(n)</i> time (where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes reachable from
   *       the start node).
   *   <li>While traversing, the traverser will use <i>O(H)</i> space (where <i>H</i> is the number
   *       of nodes that have been seen but not yet visited, that is, the "horizon").
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Examples</b> (all edges are directed facing downwards)
   *
   * <p>The graph below would be valid input with start nodes of {@code a, f, c}. However, if {@code
   * b} were <i>also</i> a start node, then there would be multiple paths to reach {@code e} and
   * {@code h}.
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   *    a     b      c
   *   / \   / \     |
   *  /   \ /   \    |
   * d     e     f   g
   *       |
   *       |
   *       h
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>.

   * <p><b>Note on binary trees</b>
   *
   * <p>This method can be used to traverse over a binary tree. Given methods {@code
   * leftChild(node)} and {@code rightChild(node)}, this method can be called as
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Traverser.forTree(node -> ImmutableList.of(leftChild(node), rightChild(node)));
   * }</pre>

   *     one path between any two nodes
