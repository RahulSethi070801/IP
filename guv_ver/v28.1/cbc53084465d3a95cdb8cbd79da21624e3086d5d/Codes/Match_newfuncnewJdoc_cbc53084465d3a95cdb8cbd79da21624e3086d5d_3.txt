   * Returns an unmodifiable {@code Iterable} over the nodes reachable from any of the {@code
   * startNodes}, in the order of a depth-first pre-order traversal. This is equivalent to a
   * depth-first pre-order traversal of a graph with an additional root node whose successors are
   * the listed {@code startNodes}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any of {@code startNodes} is not an element of the graph
   * @see #depthFirstPreOrder(Object)
