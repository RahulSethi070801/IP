   * Returns the single edge directly connecting {@code nodeU} to {@code nodeV}, if one is present.
   *
   * <p>In an undirected network, this is equal to {@code edgeConnecting(nodeV, nodeU)}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if there are multiple parallel edges connecting {@code nodeU}
   *     to {@code nodeV}
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code nodeU} or {@code nodeV} is not an element of this
   *     network
