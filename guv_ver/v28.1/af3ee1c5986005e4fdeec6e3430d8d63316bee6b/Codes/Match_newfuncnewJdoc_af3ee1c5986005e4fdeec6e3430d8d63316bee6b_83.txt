   * Returns true if there is an edge that directly connects {@code endpoints} (in the order, if
   * any, specified by {@code endpoints}).
   *
   * <p>Unlike the other {@code EndpointPair}-accepting methods, this method does not throw if the
   * endpoints are unordered and the graph is directed; it simply returns {@code false}. This is for
   * consistency with {@link Graph#hasEdgeConnecting(EndpointPair)} and {@link
   * ValueGraph#hasEdgeConnecting(EndpointPair)}.
