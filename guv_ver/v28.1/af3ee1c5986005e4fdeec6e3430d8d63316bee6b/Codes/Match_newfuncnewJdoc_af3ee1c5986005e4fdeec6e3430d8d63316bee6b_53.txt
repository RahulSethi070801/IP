   * exists.
   *
   * <p>If this graph is directed, the endpoints must be ordered.

   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if there are multiple parallel edges connecting {@code nodeU}
   *     to {@code nodeV}
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either endpoint is not an element of this network
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the endpoints are unordered and the graph is directed
