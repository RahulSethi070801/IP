   * Returns the set of edges that each directly connect {@code endpoints} (in the order, if any,
   * specified by {@code endpoints}).
   *
   * <p>The resulting set of edges will be parallel (i.e. have equal {@link #incidentNodes(Object)}.
   * If this network does not {@link #allowsParallelEdges() allow parallel edges}, the resulting set
   * will contain at most one edge (equivalent to {@code edgeConnecting(endpoints).asSet()}).
   *
   * <p>If this network is directed, {@code endpoints} must be ordered.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either endpoint is not an element of this network
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the endpoints are unordered and the graph is directed
