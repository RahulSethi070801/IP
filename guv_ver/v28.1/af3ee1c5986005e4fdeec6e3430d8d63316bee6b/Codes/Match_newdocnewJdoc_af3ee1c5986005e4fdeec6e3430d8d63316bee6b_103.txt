   * Returns the set of edges that each directly connect {@code nodeU} to {@code nodeV}.
   *
   * <p>In an undirected network, this is equal to {@code edgesConnecting(nodeV, nodeU)}.
   *
   * <p>The resulting set of edges will be parallel (i.e. have equal {@link #incidentNodes(Object)}.
   * If this network does not {@link #allowsParallelEdges() allow parallel edges}, the resulting set
   * will contain at most one edge (equivalent to {@code edgeConnecting(nodeU, nodeV).asSet()}).
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code nodeU} or {@code nodeV} is not an element of this
   *     network
