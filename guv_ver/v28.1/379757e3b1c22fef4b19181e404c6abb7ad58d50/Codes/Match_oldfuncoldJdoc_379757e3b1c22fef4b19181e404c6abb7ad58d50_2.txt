   * Returns a hash function implementing the MD5 hash algorithm (128 hash bits) by delegating to
   * the MD5 {@link MessageDigest}.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> MD5 is not cryptographically secure or collision-resistant and is not
   * recommended for use in new code. It should be used for legacy compatibility reasons only.
   * Please consider using a hash function in the SHA-2 family of functions (e.g., SHA-256).
