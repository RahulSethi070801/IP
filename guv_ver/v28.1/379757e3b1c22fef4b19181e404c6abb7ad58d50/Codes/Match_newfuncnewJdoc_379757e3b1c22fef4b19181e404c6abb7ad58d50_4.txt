   * Returns a hash function implementing the SHA-1 algorithm (160 hash bits).
   *
   * @deprecated If you must interoperate with a system that requires SHA-1, then use this method,
   *     despite its deprecation. But if you can choose your hash function, avoid SHA-1, which is
   *     neither fast nor secure. As of January 2017, we suggest:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>For security:
   *           {@link Hashing#sha256} or a higher-level API.
   *       <li>For speed: {@link Hashing#goodFastHash}, though see its docs for caveats.
   *     </ul>
