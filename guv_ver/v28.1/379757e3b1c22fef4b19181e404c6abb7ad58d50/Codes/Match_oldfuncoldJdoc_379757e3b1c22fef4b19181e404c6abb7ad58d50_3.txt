   * Returns a hash function implementing the SHA-1 algorithm (160 hash bits) by delegating to the
   * SHA-1 {@link MessageDigest}.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> SHA1 is not cryptographically secure and is not recommended for use in new
   * code. It should be used for legacy compatibility reasons only. Please consider using a hash
   * function in the SHA-2 family of functions (e.g., SHA-256).
