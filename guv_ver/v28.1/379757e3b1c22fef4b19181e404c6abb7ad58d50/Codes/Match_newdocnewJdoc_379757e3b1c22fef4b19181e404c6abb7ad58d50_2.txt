   * Returns a general-purpose, <b>temporary-use</b>, non-cryptographic hash function. The algorithm
   * the returned function implements is unspecified and subject to change without notice.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> a new random seed for these functions is chosen each time the {@code
   * Hashing} class is loaded. <b>Do not use this method</b> if hash codes may escape the current
   * process in any way, for example being sent over RPC, or saved to disk. For a general-purpose,
   * non-cryptographic hash function that will never change behavior, we suggest {@link
   * #murmur3_128}.
   *
   * <p>Repeated calls to this method on the same loaded {@code Hashing} class, using the same value
   * for {@code minimumBits}, will return identically-behaving {@link HashFunction} instances.
   *
   * @param minimumBits a positive integer (can be arbitrarily large)
   * @return a hash function, described above, that produces hash codes of length {@code
   *     minimumBits} or greater
