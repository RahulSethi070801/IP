   * Returns a stream in which each element is the result of passing the corresponding element of
   * each of {@code streamA} and {@code streamB} to {@code function}.
   *
   * <p>For example:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * Streams.zip(
   *   Stream.of("foo1", "foo2", "foo3"),
   *   Stream.of("bar1", "bar2"),
   *   (arg1, arg2) -> arg1 + ":" + arg2)
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>will return {@code Stream.of("foo1:bar1", "foo2:bar2")}.
   *
   * <p>The resulting stream will only be as long as the shorter of the two input streams; if one
   * stream is longer, its extra elements will be ignored.
   *
   * <p>The resulting stream is not <a
   * href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/StreamParallelGuidance.html">efficiently splittable</a>.
   * This may harm parallel performance.
