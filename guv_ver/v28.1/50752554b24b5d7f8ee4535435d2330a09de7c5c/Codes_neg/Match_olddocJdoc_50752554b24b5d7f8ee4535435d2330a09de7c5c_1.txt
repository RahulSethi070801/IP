   * Continue execution of tasks after a call to {@link #suspend()}. More accurately, decreases the
   * suspension counter, as has been incremented by calls to {@link #suspend}, and resumes execution
   * if the suspension counter is zero.
   *
   * <p>If this method throws, e.g. a {@code RejectedExecutionException} from the delegate executor,
   * execution of tasks will stop until a call to this method or to {@link #execute(Runnable)} or
   * {@link #executeFirst(Runnable)} is made.
   *
   * @throws java.lang.IllegalStateException if this executor is not suspended.
