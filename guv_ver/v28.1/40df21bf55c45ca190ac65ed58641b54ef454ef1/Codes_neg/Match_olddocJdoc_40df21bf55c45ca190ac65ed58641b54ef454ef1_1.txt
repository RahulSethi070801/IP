   * Returns the portion of this domain name that is one level beneath the public suffix. For
   * example, for {@code x.adwords.google.co.uk} it returns {@code google.co.uk}, since
   * {@code co.uk} is a public suffix.
   *
   * <p>If {@link #isTopPrivateDomain()} is true, the current domain name instance is returned.
   *
   * <p>This method should not be used to determine the topmost parent domain which is addressable
   * as a host, as many public suffixes are also addressable hosts. For example, the domain
   * {@code foo.bar.uk.com} has a public suffix of {@code uk.com}, so it would return
   * {@code bar.uk.com} from this method. But {@code uk.com} is itself an addressable host.
   *
   * <p>This method can be used to determine the probable highest level parent domain for which
   * cookies may be set, though even that depends on individual browsers' implementations of cookie
   * controls.
   *
   * @throws IllegalStateException if this domain does not end with a public suffix
   * @since 6.0
