   * Indicates whether this domain name ends in a {@linkplain #isPublicSuffix() public suffix},
   * while not being a public suffix itself. For example, returns {@code true} for
   * {@code www.google.com}, {@code foo.co.uk} and {@code bar.ca.us}, but not for {@code google},
   * {@code com}, or {@code
   * google.foo}.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> a {@code false} result from this method does not imply that the domain does
   * not represent an addressable host, as many public suffixes are also addressable hosts. Use
   * {@link #hasPublicSuffix()} for that test.
   *
   * <p>This method can be used to determine whether it will probably be possible to set cookies on
   * the domain, though even that depends on individual browsers' implementations of cookie
   * controls. See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt">RFC 2109</a> for details.
