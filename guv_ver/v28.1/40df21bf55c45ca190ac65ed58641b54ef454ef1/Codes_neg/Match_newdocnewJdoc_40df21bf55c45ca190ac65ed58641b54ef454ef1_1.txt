   * Returns the portion of this domain name that is one level beneath the {@linkplain
   * #isPublicSuffix() public suffix}. For example, for {@code x.adwords.google.co.uk} it returns
   * {@code google.co.uk}, since {@code co.uk} is a public suffix. Similarly, for {@code
   * myblog.blogspot.com} it returns the same domain, {@code myblog.blogspot.com}, since {@code
   * blogspot.com} is a public suffix.
   *
   * <p>If {@link #isTopPrivateDomain()} is true, the current domain name instance is returned.
   *
   * <p>This method can be used to determine the probable highest level parent domain for which
   * cookies may be set, though even that depends on individual browsers' implementations of cookie
   * controls.
   *
   * @throws IllegalStateException if this domain does not end with a public suffix
   * @since 6.0
