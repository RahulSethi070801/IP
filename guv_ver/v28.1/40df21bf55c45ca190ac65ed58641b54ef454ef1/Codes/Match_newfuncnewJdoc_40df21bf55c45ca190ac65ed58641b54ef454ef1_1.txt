   * Indicates whether this domain name represents a <i>registry suffix</i>, as defined by a subset
   * of the Mozilla Foundation's <a href="http://publicsuffix.org/">Public Suffix List</a> (PSL). A
   * registry suffix is one under which Internet users can directly register names via a domain name
   * registrar, and have such registrations lawfully protected by internet-governing bodies such as
   * ICANN. Examples of registry suffixes include {@code com}, {@code co.uk}, and {@code
   * pvt.k12.wy.us}. Examples of domain names that are <i>not</i> registry suffixes include {@code
   * google.com} and {@code foo.co.uk}.
   *
   * <p>Registry suffixes are a proper subset of {@linkplain #isPublicSuffix() public suffixes}. The
   * list of public suffixes additionally contains privately owned domain names under which Internet
   * users can register subdomains. An example of a public suffix that is not a registry suffix is
   * {@code blogspot.com}. Note that it is true that all public suffixes <i>have</i> registry
   * suffixes, since domain name registries collectively control all internet domain names.
   *
   * <p>For considerations on whether the public suffix or registry suffix designation is more
   * suitable for your application, see <a
   * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/InternetDomainNameExplained">this article</a>.
