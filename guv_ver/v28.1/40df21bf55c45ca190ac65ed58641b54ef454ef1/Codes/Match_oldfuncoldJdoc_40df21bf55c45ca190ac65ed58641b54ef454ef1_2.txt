   * Indicates whether this domain name ends in a {@linkplain #isPublicSuffix() public suffix},
   * including if it is a public suffix itself. For example, returns {@code true} for
   * {@code www.google.com}, {@code foo.co.uk} and {@code com}, but not for {@code invalid} or
   * {@code google.invalid}. This is the recommended method for determining whether a domain is
   * potentially an addressable host.
