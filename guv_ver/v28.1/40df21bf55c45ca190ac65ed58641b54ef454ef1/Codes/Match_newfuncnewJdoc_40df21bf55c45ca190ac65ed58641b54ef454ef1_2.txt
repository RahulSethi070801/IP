   * Indicates whether this domain name ends in a {@linkplain #isPublicSuffix() public suffix},
   * including if it is a public suffix itself. For example, returns {@code true} for {@code
   * www.google.com}, {@code foo.co.uk} and {@code com}, but not for {@code invalid} or {@code
   * google.invalid}. This is the recommended method for determining whether a domain is potentially
   * an addressable host.
   *
   * <p>Note that this method is equivalent to {@link #hasRegistrySuffix()} because all registry
   * suffixes are public suffixes <i>and</i> all public suffixes have registry suffixes.
