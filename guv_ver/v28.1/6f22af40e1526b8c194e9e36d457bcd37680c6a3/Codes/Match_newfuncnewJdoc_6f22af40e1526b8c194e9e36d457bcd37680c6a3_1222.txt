   * An alternate form of {@code put} that silently removes any existing entry with the value {@code
   * value} before proceeding with the {@link #put} operation. If the bimap previously contained the
   * provided key-value mapping, this method has no effect.
   *
   * <p>Note that a successful call to this method could cause the size of the bimap to increase by
   * one, stay the same, or even decrease by one.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> If an existing entry with this value is removed, the key for that entry is
   * discarded and not returned.

   * @param key the key with which the specified value is to be associated
   * @param value the value to be associated with the specified key
   * @return the value which was previously associated with the key, which may be {@code null}, or
   *     {@code null} if there was no previous entry
