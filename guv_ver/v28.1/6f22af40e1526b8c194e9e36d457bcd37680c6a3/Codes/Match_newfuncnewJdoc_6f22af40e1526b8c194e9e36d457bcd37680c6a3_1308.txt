   * Parses the specified string as a single-precision floating point value. The ASCII character
   * {@code '-'} (<code>'&#92;u002D'</code>) is recognized as the minus sign.
   *
   * <p>Unlike {@link Float#parseFloat(String)}, this method returns {@code null} instead of
   * throwing an exception if parsing fails. Valid inputs are exactly those accepted by {@link
   * Float#valueOf(String)}, except that leading and trailing whitespace is not permitted.
   *
   * <p>This implementation is likely to be faster than {@code Float.parseFloat} if many failures
   * are expected.
   *
   * @param string the string representation of a {@code float} value
   * @return the floating point value represented by {@code string}, or {@code null} if {@code
   *     string} has a length of zero or cannot be parsed as a {@code float} value
   * @since 14.0
