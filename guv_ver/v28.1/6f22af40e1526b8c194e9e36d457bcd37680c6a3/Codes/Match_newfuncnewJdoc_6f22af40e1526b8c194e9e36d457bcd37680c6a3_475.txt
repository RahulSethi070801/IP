   * Stores a key-value pair in this multimap.
   *
   * <p>Some multimap implementations allow duplicate key-value pairs, in which case {@code put}
   * always adds a new key-value pair and increases the multimap size by 1. Other implementations
   * prohibit duplicates, and storing a key-value pair that's already in the multimap has no effect.
   *
   * @return {@code true} if the method increased the size of the multimap, or {@code false} if the
   *     multimap already contained the key-value pair and doesn't allow duplicates
