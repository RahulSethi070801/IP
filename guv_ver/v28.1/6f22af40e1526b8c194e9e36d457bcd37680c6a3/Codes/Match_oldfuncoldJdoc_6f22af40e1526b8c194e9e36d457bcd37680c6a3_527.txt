   * Generates a hash code for multiple values. The hash code is generated by calling {@link
   * Arrays#hashCode(Object[])}. Note that array arguments to this method, with the exception of a
   * single Object array, do not get any special handling; their hash codes are based on identity
   * and not contents.
   *
   * <p>This is useful for implementing {@link Object#hashCode()}. For example, in an object that
   * has three properties, {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, one could write:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * public int hashCode() {
   *   return Objects.hashCode(getX(), getY(), getZ());
   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> When a single object is supplied, the returned hash code does not equal the
   * hash code of that object.
   *
   * <p><b>Note for Java 7 and later:</b> This method should be treated as deprecated; use {@link
   * java.util.Objects#hash} instead.
