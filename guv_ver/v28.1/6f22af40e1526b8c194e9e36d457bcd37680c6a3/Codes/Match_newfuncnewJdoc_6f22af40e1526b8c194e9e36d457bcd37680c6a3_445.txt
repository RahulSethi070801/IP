   * Returns an unmodifiable list containing the specified first element and backed by the specified
   * array of additional elements. Changes to the {@code rest} array will be reflected in the
   * returned list. Unlike {@link Arrays#asList}, the returned list is unmodifiable.
   *
   * <p>This is useful when a varargs method needs to use a signature such as {@code (Foo firstFoo,
   * Foo... moreFoos)}, in order to avoid overload ambiguity or to enforce a minimum argument count.
   *
   * <p>The returned list is serializable and implements {@link RandomAccess}.
   *
   * @param first the first element
   * @param rest an array of additional elements, possibly empty
   * @return an unmodifiable list containing the specified elements
