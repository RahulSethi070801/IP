   * Returns an unmodifiable view of the difference of two multisets. In the returned multiset, the
   * count of each element is the result of the <i>zero-truncated subtraction</i> of its count in
   * the second multiset from its count in the first multiset, with elements that would have a count
   * of 0 not included. The iteration order of the returned multiset matches that of the element set
   * of {@code multiset1}, with repeated occurrences of the same element appearing consecutively.
   *
   * <p>Results are undefined if {@code multiset1} and {@code multiset2} are based on different
   * equivalence relations (as {@code HashMultiset} and {@code TreeMultiset} are).
