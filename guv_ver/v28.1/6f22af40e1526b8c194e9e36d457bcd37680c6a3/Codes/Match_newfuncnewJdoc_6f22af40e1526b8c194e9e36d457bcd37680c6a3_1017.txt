   * Returns {@code true} if the given objects are considered equivalent.
   *
   * <p>This method describes an <i>equivalence relation</i> on object references, meaning that for
   * all references {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z} (any of which may be null):
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code equivalent(x, x)} is true (<i>reflexive</i> property)
   *   <li>{@code equivalent(x, y)} and {@code equivalent(y, x)} each return the same result
   *       (<i>symmetric</i> property)
   *   <li>If {@code equivalent(x, y)} and {@code equivalent(y, z)} are both true, then {@code
   *       equivalent(x, z)} is also true (<i>transitive</i> property)
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Note that all calls to {@code equivalent(x, y)} are expected to return the same result as
   * long as neither {@code x} nor {@code y} is modified.
