   * Parses the specified string as a signed decimal long value. The ASCII character {@code '-'} (
   * <code>'&#92;u002D'</code>) is recognized as the minus sign.
   *
   * <p>Unlike {@link Long#parseLong(String)}, this method returns {@code null} instead of throwing
   * an exception if parsing fails. Additionally, this method only accepts ASCII digits, and returns
   * {@code null} if non-ASCII digits are present in the string.
   *
   * <p>Note that strings prefixed with ASCII {@code '+'} are rejected, even under JDK 7, despite
   * the change to {@link Long#parseLong(String)} for that version.
   *
   * @param string the string representation of a long value
   * @return the long value represented by {@code string}, or {@code null} if {@code string} has a
   *     length of zero or cannot be parsed as a long value
   * @since 14.0
