   * Returns the set of all subsets of {@code set} of size {@code size}. For example, {@code
   * combinations(ImmutableSet.of(1, 2, 3), 2)} returns the set {@code {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}}.
   *
   * <p>Elements appear in these subsets in the same iteration order as they appeared in the input
   * set. The order in which these subsets appear in the outer set is undefined.
   *
   * <p>The returned set and its constituent sets use {@code equals} to decide whether two elements
   * are identical, even if the input set uses a different concept of equivalence.
   *
   * <p><i>Performance notes:</i> the memory usage of the returned set is only {@code O(n)}. When
   * the result set is constructed, the input set is merely copied. Only as the result set is
   * iterated are the individual subsets created. Each of these subsets occupies an additional O(n)
   * memory but only for as long as the user retains a reference to it. That is, the set returned by
   * {@code combinations} does not retain the individual subsets.
   *
   * @param set the set of elements to take combinations of
   * @param size the number of elements per combination
   * @return the set of all combinations of {@code size} elements from {@code set}
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code size} is not between 0 and {@code set.size()}
   *     inclusive
   * @throws NullPointerException if {@code set} is or contains {@code null}
