   * Parses the specified string as a signed decimal integer value. The ASCII character {@code '-'}
   * (<code>'&#92;u002D'</code>) is recognized as the minus sign.
   *
   * <p>Unlike {@link Integer#parseInt(String)}, this method returns {@code null} instead of
   * throwing an exception if parsing fails. Additionally, this method only accepts ASCII digits,
   * and returns {@code null} if non-ASCII digits are present in the string.
   *
   * <p>Note that strings prefixed with ASCII {@code '+'} are rejected, even under JDK 7, despite
   * the change to {@link Integer#parseInt(String)} for that version.
   *
   * @param string the string representation of an integer value
   * @return the integer value represented by {@code string}, or {@code null} if {@code string} has
   *     a length of zero or cannot be parsed as an integer value
   * @since 11.0
