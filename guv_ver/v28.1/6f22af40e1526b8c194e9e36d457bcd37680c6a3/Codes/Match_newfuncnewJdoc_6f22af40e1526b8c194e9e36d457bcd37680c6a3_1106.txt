   * Reads the first line of this source as a string. Returns {@code null} if this source is empty.
   *
   * <p>Like {@link BufferedReader#readLine()}, this method considers a line to be a sequence of
   * text that is terminated by (but does not include) one of {@code \r\n}, {@code \r} or {@code
   * \n}. If the source's content does not end in a line termination sequence, it is treated as if
   * it does.
   *
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while reading from this source
