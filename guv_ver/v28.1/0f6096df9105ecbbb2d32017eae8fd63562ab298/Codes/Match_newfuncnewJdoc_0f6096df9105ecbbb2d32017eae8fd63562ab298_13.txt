   * Returns a {@link ValueGraphBuilder} initialized with all properties queryable from {@code
   * graph}.
   *
   * <p>The "queryable" properties are those that are exposed through the {@link ValueGraph}
   * interface, such as {@link ValueGraph#isDirected()}. Other properties, such as {@link
   * #expectedNodeCount(int)}, are not set in the new builder.
