   * Returns a {@link NetworkBuilder} initialized with all properties queryable from {@code
   * network}.
   *
   * <p>The "queryable" properties are those that are exposed through the {@link Network} interface,
   * such as {@link Network#isDirected()}. Other properties, such as {@link
   * #expectedNodeCount(int)}, are not set in the new builder.
