   * Returns a new {@code Future} whose result is asynchronously derived from the result of the
   * given {@code Future}. If the given {@code Future} fails, the returned {@code Future} fails with
   * the same exception (and the function is not invoked).
   *
   * <p>More precisely, the returned {@code Future} takes its result from a {@code Future} produced
   * by applying the given {@code AsyncFunction} to the result of the original {@code Future}.
   * Example usage:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * ListenableFuture<RowKey> rowKeyFuture = indexService.lookUp(query);
   * ListenableFuture<QueryResult> queryFuture =
   *     transformAsync(rowKeyFuture, dataService::readFuture);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>This overload, which does not accept an executor, uses {@code directExecutor}, a dangerous
   * choice in some cases. See the discussion in the {@link ListenableFuture#addListener
   * ListenableFuture.addListener} documentation. All its warnings about heavyweight listeners are
   * also applicable to heavyweight functions passed to this method. (Specifically, {@code
   * directExecutor} functions should avoid heavyweight operations inside {@code
   * AsyncFunction.apply}. Any heavyweight operations should occur in other threads responsible for
   * completing the returned {@code Future}.)
   *
   * <p>The returned {@code Future} attempts to keep its cancellation state in sync with that of the
   * input future and that of the future returned by the function. That is, if the returned {@code
   * Future} is cancelled, it will attempt to cancel the other two, and if either of the other two
   * is cancelled, the returned {@code Future} will receive a callback in which it will attempt to
   * cancel itself.
   *
   * @param input The future to transform
   * @param function A function to transform the result of the input future to the result of the
   *     output future
   * @return A future that holds result of the function (if the input succeeded) or the original
   *     input's failure (if not)
   * @since 19.0 (in 11.0 as {@code transform})
   * @deprecated Use {@linkplain #transformAsync(ListenableFuture, AsyncFunction, Executor) the
   *     overload that requires an executor}. For identical behavior, pass {@link
   *     MoreExecutors#directExecutor}, but consider whether another executor would be safer, as
   *     discussed in the {@link ListenableFuture#addListener ListenableFuture.addListener}
   *     documentation. This method is scheduled to be removed in April 2018.
