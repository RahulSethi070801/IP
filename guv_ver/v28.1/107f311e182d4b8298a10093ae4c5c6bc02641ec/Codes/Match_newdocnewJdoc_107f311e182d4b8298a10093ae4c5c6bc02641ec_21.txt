   * Returns a new {@code Future} whose result is derived from the result of the given {@code
   * Future}. If {@code input} fails, the returned {@code Future} fails with the same exception (and
   * the function is not invoked). Example usage:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * ListenableFuture<QueryResult> queryFuture = ...;
   * ListenableFuture<List<Row>> rowsFuture =
   *     transform(queryFuture, QueryResult::getRows, executor);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>When selecting an executor, note that {@code directExecutor} is dangerous in some cases. See
   * the discussion in the {@link ListenableFuture#addListener ListenableFuture.addListener}
   * documentation. All its warnings about heavyweight listeners are also applicable to heavyweight
   * functions passed to this method.
   *
   * <p>The returned {@code Future} attempts to keep its cancellation state in sync with that of the
   * input future. That is, if the returned {@code Future} is cancelled, it will attempt to cancel
   * the input, and if the input is cancelled, the returned {@code Future} will receive a callback
   * in which it will attempt to cancel itself.
   *
   * <p>An example use of this method is to convert a serializable object returned from an RPC into
   * a POJO.
   *
   * @param input The future to transform
   * @param function A Function to transform the results of the provided future to the results of
   *     the returned future.
   * @param executor Executor to run the function in.
   * @return A future that holds result of the transformation.
   * @since 9.0 (in 2.0 as {@code compose})
