   * Registers separate success and failure callbacks to be run when the {@code Future}'s
   * computation is {@linkplain java.util.concurrent.Future#isDone() complete} or, if the
   * computation is already complete, immediately.
   *
   * <p>The callback is run in {@code executor}. There is no guaranteed ordering of execution of
   * callbacks, but any callback added through this method is guaranteed to be called once the
   * computation is complete.
   *
   * Example: <pre> {@code
   * ListenableFuture<QueryResult> future = ...;
   * Executor e = ...
   * addCallback(future,
   *     new FutureCallback<QueryResult>() {
   *       public void onSuccess(QueryResult result) {
   *         storeInCache(result);
   *       }
   *       public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
   *         reportError(t);
   *       }
   *     }, e);}</pre>
   *
   * <p>When selecting an executor, note that {@code directExecutor} is dangerous in some cases. See
   * the discussion in the {@link ListenableFuture#addListener ListenableFuture.addListener}
   * documentation.
   *
   * <p>For a more general interface to attach a completion listener to a {@code Future}, see {@link
   * ListenableFuture#addListener addListener}.
   *
   * @param future The future attach the callback to.
   * @param callback The callback to invoke when {@code future} is completed.
   * @param executor The executor to run {@code callback} when the future completes.
