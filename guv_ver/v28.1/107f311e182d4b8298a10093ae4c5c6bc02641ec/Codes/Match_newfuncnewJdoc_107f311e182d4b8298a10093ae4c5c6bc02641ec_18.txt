   * Returns a new {@code Future} whose result is asynchronously derived from the result of this
   * {@code Future}. If the input {@code Future} fails, the returned {@code Future} fails with the
   * same exception (and the function is not invoked).
   *
   * <p>More precisely, the returned {@code Future} takes its result from a {@code Future} produced
   * by applying the given {@code AsyncFunction} to the result of the original {@code Future}.
   * Example usage:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * FluentFuture<RowKey> rowKeyFuture = FluentFuture.from(indexService.lookUp(query));
   * ListenableFuture<QueryResult> queryFuture =
   *     rowKeyFuture.transformAsync(dataService::readFuture, executor);
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>When selecting an executor, note that {@code directExecutor} is dangerous in some cases. See
   * the discussion in the {@link #addListener} documentation. All its warnings about heavyweight
   * listeners are also applicable to heavyweight functions passed to this method. (Specifically,
   * {@code directExecutor} functions should avoid heavyweight operations inside {@code
   * AsyncFunction.apply}. Any heavyweight operations should occur in other threads responsible for
   * completing the returned {@code Future}.)
   *
   * <p>The returned {@code Future} attempts to keep its cancellation state in sync with that of the
   * input future and that of the future returned by the chain function. That is, if the returned
   * {@code Future} is cancelled, it will attempt to cancel the other two, and if either of the
   * other two is cancelled, the returned {@code Future} will receive a callback in which it will
   * attempt to cancel itself.
   *
   * <p>This method is similar to {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#thenCompose} and
   * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#thenComposeAsync}. It can also serve some of the
   * use cases of {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#handle} and {@link
   * java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#handleAsync} when used along with {@link #catching}.
   *
   * @param function A function to transform the result of this future to the result of the output
   *     future
   * @param executor Executor to run the function in.
   * @return A future that holds result of the function (if the input succeeded) or the original
   *     input's failure (if not)
