   * Maps a file in to memory as per
   * {@link FileChannel#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode, long, long)} using the requested
   * {@link MapMode}.
   *
   * <p>Files are mapped from offset 0 to {@code size}.
   *
   * <p>If the mode is {@link MapMode#READ_WRITE} and the file does not exist, it will be created
   * with the requested {@code size}. Thus this method is useful for creating memory mapped files
   * which do not yet exist.
   *
   * <p>This only works for files <= {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} bytes.
   *
   * @param file the file to map
   * @param mode the mode to use when mapping {@code file}
   * @return a buffer reflecting {@code file}
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
