   * Returns a {@code URL} pointing to {@code resourceName} if the resource is found using the
   * {@linkplain Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class loader}. In simple environments, the
   * context class loader will find resources from the class path. In environments where different
   * threads can have different class loaders, for example app servers, the context class loader
   * will typically have been set to an appropriate loader for the current thread.
   *
   * <p>In the unusual case where the context class loader is null, the class loader that loaded
   * this class ({@code Resources}) will be used instead.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the resource is not found
