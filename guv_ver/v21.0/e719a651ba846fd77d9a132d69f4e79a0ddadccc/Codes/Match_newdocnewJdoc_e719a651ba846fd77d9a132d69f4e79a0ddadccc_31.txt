   * Returns the size of this source in bytes, even if doing so requires opening and traversing an
   * entire stream. To avoid a potentially expensive operation, see {@link #sizeIfKnown}.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation calls {@link #sizeIfKnown} and returns the value if present. If
   * absent, it will fall back to a heavyweight operation that will open a stream, read (or
   * {@link InputStream#skip(long) skip}, if possible) to the end of the stream and return the total
   * number of bytes that were read.
   *
   * <p>Note that for some sources that implement {@link #sizeIfKnown} to provide a more efficient
   * implementation, it is <i>possible</i> that this method will return a different number of bytes
   * than would be returned by reading all of the bytes (for example, some special files may return
   * a size of 0 despite actually having content when read).
   *
   * <p>In either case, for mutable sources such as files, a subsequent read may return a different
   * number of bytes if the contents are changed.
   *
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs in the process of reading the size of this source
