   * Returns whether the source has zero bytes. The default implementation returns true if
   * {@link #sizeIfKnown} returns zero, falling back to opening a stream and checking for
   * EOF if the size is not known.
   *
   * <p>Note that, in cases where {@code sizeIfKnown} returns zero, it is <i>possible</i> that bytes
   * are actually available for reading. (For example, some special files may return a size of 0
   * despite actually having content when read.) This means that a source may return {@code true}
   * from {@code isEmpty()} despite having readable content.
   *
   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
   * @since 15.0
