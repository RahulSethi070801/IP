   * Returns the size of this source in bytes, if the size can be easily determined without
   * actually opening the data stream.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation returns {@link Optional#absent}. Some sources, such as a file,
   * may return a non-absent value. Note that in such cases, it is <i>possible</i> that this method
   * will return a different number of bytes than would be returned by reading all of the bytes (for
   * example, some special files may return a size of 0 despite actually having content when read).
   *
   * <p>Additionally, for mutable sources such as files, a subsequent read may return a different
   * number of bytes if the contents are changed.
