   * Adds {@code edge} to this graph, connecting {@code node1} to {@code node2}
   * (optional operation).
   *
   * <p><b>Edges must be unique</b>, just as {@code Map} keys must be; they must also be non-null.
   *
   * <p>If {@code edge} already connects {@code node1} to {@code node2} in this graph
   * (in the specified order if order is significant, as for directed graphs, else in any order),
   * then this method will have no effect and will return {@code false}.
   *
   * <p>Behavior if {@code node1} and {@code node2} are not already elements of the graph is
   * unspecified. Suggested behaviors include (a) silently adding {@code node1} and {@code node2}
   * to the graph or (b) throwing {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
   *
   * @return {@code true} iff the graph was modified as a result of this call
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code edge} already exists and connects nodes other than
   *     {@code node1} and {@code node2}, or if the graph is not a multigraph and {@code node1} is
   *     already connected to {@code node2}
   * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the add operation is not supported by this graph
