   * Specifies that each entry should be automatically removed from the map once a fixed duration
   * has elapsed after the entry's last read or write access.
   *
   * <p>When {@code duration} is zero, elements can be successfully added to the map, but are
   * evicted immediately. This has a very similar effect to invoking {@link #maximumSize
   * maximumSize}{@code (0)}. It can be useful in testing, or to disable caching temporarily without
   * a code change.
   *
   * <p>Expired entries may be counted by {@link Map#size}, but will never be visible to read or
   * write operations. Expired entries are currently cleaned up during write operations, or during
   * occasional read operations in the absense of writes; though this behavior may change in the
   * future.
   *
   * @param duration the length of time after an entry is last accessed that it should be
   *     automatically removed
   * @param unit the unit that {@code duration} is expressed in
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code duration} is negative
   * @throws IllegalStateException if the time to idle or time to live was already set
