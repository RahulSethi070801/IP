   * Returns a tree traverser that uses the given function to navigate from a node to its children.
   * This is useful if the function instance already exists, or so that you can supply a lambda
   * expressions. If those circumstances don't apply, you probably don't need to use this; subclass
   * {@code TreeTraverser} and implement its {@link #children} method directly.
