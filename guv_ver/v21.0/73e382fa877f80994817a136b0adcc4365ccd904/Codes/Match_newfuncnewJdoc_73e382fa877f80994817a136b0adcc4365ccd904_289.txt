   * Adds all of the specified ranges to this range set (optional operation). After this operation,
   * this range set is the minimal range set that {@linkplain #enclosesAll(RangeSet) encloses} both
   * the original range set and each range in {@code other}.
   *
   * <p>This is equivalent to calling {@link #add} on each of the ranges in {@code other} in turn.
   *
   * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this range set does not support the {@code addAll}
   *     operation
