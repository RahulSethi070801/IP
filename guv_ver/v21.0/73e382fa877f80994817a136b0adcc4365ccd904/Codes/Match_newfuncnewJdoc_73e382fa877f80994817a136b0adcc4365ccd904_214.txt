   * Returns an unmodifiable <b>view</b> of the difference of two sets. The
   * returned set contains all elements that are contained by {@code set1} and
   * not contained by {@code set2}. {@code set2} may also contain elements not
   * present in {@code set1}; these are simply ignored. The iteration order of
   * the returned set matches that of {@code set1}.
   *
   * <p>Results are undefined if {@code set1} and {@code set2} are sets based
   * on different equivalence relations (as {@code HashSet}, {@code TreeSet},
   * and the keySet of an {@code IdentityHashMap} all are).
