   * Returns an unmodifiable iterable over the nodes in a tree structure, using post-order
   * traversal. That is, each node's subtrees are traversed before the node itself is returned.
   *
   * <p>No guarantees are made about the behavior of the traversal when nodes change while
   * iteration is in progress or when the iterators generated by {@link #children} are advanced.
