   * Returns a view containing the result of applying {@code function} to each
   * element of {@code fromIterable}.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} if {@code
   * fromIterable}'s iterator does. After a successful {@code remove()} call,
   * {@code fromIterable} no longer contains the corresponding element.
   *
   * <p>If the input {@code Iterable} is known to be a {@code List} or other
   * {@code Collection}, consider {@link Lists#transform} and {@link
   * Collections2#transform}.
