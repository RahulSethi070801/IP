   * Returns an {@code ImmutableList} containing all of the elements from this {@code
   * FluentIterable} in the order specified by {@code comparator}. To produce an {@code
   * ImmutableList} sorted by its natural ordering, use {@code toSortedList(Ordering.natural())}.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> {@code
   * ImmutableList.copyOf(stream.sorted(comparator).iterator())}, or after the next release of
   * Guava, pass {@link ImmutableList#toImmutableList} to {@code
   * stream.sorted(comparator).collect()}.
   *
   * @param comparator the function by which to sort list elements
   * @throws NullPointerException if any element is null
   * @since 14.0 (since 13.0 as {@code toSortedImmutableList()}).
