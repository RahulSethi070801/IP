   * Runs the specified action for each distinct element in this multiset, and the number of
   * occurrences of that element. For some {@code Multiset} implementations, this may be more
   * efficient than iterating over the {@link #entrySet()} either explicitly or with {@code
   * entrySet().forEach(action)}.
