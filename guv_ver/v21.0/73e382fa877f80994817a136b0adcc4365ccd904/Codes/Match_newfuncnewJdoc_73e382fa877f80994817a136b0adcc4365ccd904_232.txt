   * Removes, from an iterable, every element that satisfies the provided
   * predicate.
   *
   * <p>Removals may or may not happen immediately as each element is tested
   * against the predicate.  The behavior of this method is not specified if
   * {@code predicate} is dependent on {@code removeFrom}.
   *
   * <p><b>Java 8 users:</b> if {@code removeFrom} is a {@link Collection},
   * use {@code removeFrom.removeIf(predicate)} instead.
   *
   * @param removeFrom the iterable to (potentially) remove elements from
   * @param predicate a predicate that determines whether an element should
   *     be removed
   * @return {@code true} if any elements were removed from the iterable
   *
   * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the iterable does not support
   *     {@code remove()}.
   * @since 2.0
