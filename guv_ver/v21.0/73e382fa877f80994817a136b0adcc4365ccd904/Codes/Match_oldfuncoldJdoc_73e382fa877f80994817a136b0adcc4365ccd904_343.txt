   * If {@code (key, expectedOldValue)} is currently in the map, this method replaces {@code
   * expectedOldValue} with {@code newValue} and returns true; otherwise, this method returns false.
   *
   * <p>If {@code expectedOldValue} is zero, this method will succeed if {@code (key, zero)} is
   * currently in the map, or if {@code key} is not in the map at all.
