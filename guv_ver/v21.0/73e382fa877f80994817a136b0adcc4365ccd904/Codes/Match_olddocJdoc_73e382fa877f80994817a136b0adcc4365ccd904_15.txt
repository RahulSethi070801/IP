   * Returns the {@code k} greatest elements of the given iterable according to this ordering, in
   * order from greatest to least. If there are fewer than {@code k} elements present, all will be
   * included.
   *
   * <p>The implementation does not necessarily use a <i>stable</i> sorting algorithm; when multiple
   * elements are equivalent, it is undefined which will come first.
   *
   * <p><b>Java 8 users:</b> Continue to use this method for now. After the next release of Guava,
   * use {@code Streams.stream(iterable).collect(Comparators.greatest(k, thisComparator))} instead.
   *
   * @return an immutable {@code RandomAccess} list of the {@code k} greatest elements in
   *     <i>descending order</i>
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code k} is negative
   * @since 8.0
