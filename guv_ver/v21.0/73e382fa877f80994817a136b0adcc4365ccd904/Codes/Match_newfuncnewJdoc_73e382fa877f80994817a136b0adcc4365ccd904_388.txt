   * Returns the last element of the specified stream, or {@link OptionalDouble#empty} if the stream
   * is empty.
   *
   * <p>Equivalent to {@code stream.reduce((a, b) -> b)}, but may perform significantly better. This
   * method's runtime will be between O(log n) and O(n), performing better on <a

   * streams.
   *
   * @see DoubleStream#findFirst()
   * @throws NullPointerException if the last element of the stream is null
