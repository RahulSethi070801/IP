   * Returns a view of {@code unfiltered} containing all elements that are of the type {@code
   * desiredType}. The returned iterable's iterator does not support {@code remove()}.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code Stream} equivalent:</b> {@code stream.filter(type::isInstance).map(type::cast)}.
   * This does perform a little more work than necessary, so another option is to insert an
   * unchecked cast at some later point:
   *
   * <pre>
   * {@code @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // safe because of ::isInstance check
   * ImmutableList<NewType> result =
   *     (ImmutableList) stream.filter(NewType.class::isInstance).collect(toImmutableList());}
   * </pre>
