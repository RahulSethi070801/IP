   * Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map. The effect of this call is
   * equivalent to that of calling {@code put(k, v)} on this map once for each mapping from key
   * {@code k} to value {@code v} in the specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined
   * if the specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.
