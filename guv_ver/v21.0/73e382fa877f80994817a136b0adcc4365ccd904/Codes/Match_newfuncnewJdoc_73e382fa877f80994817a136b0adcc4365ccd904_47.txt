   * Returns a {@link Collector} that accumulates elements into an {@code ImmutableSortedMap}
   * whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided mapping functions to the input
   * elements.  The generated map is sorted by the specified comparator.
   *
   * <p>If the mapped keys contain duplicates (according to the specified comparator), an
   * {@code IllegalArgumentException} is thrown when the collection operation is performed.
   * (This differs from the {@code Collector} returned by
   * {@link Collectors#toMap(Function, Function)}, which throws an {@code IllegalStateException}.)
