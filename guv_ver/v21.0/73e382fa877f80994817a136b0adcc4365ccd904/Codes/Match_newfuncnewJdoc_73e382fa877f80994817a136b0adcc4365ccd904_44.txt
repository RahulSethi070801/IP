   * Performs the given action for all key-value pairs contained in this multimap. If an ordering is
   * specified by the {@code Multimap} implementation, actions will be performed in the order of
   * iteration of {@link #entries()}. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.
   *
   * <p>To loop over all keys and their associated value collections, write
   * {@code Multimaps.asMap(multimap).forEach((key, valueCollection) -> action())}.
