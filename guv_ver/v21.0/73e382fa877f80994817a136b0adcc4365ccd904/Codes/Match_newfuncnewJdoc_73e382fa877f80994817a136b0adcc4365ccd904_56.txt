   * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into an {@code ImmutableMultiset}
   * whose elements are the result of applying {@code elementFunction} to the inputs,
   * with counts equal to the result of applying {@code countFunction} to the inputs.
   *
   * <p>If the mapped elements contain duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals}),
   * the first occurrence in encounter order appears in the resulting multiset, with count
   * equal to the sum of the outputs of {@code countFunction.applyAsInt(t)} for each {@code t}
   * mapped to that element.
