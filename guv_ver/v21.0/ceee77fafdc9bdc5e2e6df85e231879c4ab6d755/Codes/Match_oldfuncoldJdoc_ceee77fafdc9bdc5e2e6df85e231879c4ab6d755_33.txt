   * Returns a {@link ValueGraphBuilder} initialized with all properties queryable from
   * {@code graph}.
   *
   * <p>The "queryable" properties are those that are exposed through the {@link Graph} interface,
   * such as {@link Graph#isDirected()}. Other properties, such as {@link #expectedNodeCount(int)},
   * are not set in the new builder.
