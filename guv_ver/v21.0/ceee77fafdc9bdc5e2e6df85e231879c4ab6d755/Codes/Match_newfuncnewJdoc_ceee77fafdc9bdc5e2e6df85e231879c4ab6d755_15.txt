   * Returns true iff {@code graph} has at least one cycle. A cycle is defined as a non-empty
   * subset of edges in a graph arranged to form a path (a sequence of adjacent outgoing edges)
   * starting and ending with the same node.
   *
   * <p>This method will detect any non-empty cycle, including self-loops (a cycle of length 1).
