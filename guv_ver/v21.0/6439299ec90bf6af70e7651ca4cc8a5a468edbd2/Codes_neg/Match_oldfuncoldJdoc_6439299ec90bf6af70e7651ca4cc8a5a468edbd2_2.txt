   * Add nodes that are not elements of the graph, then add {@code edge} between them.
   * Return {@code false} if {@code edge} already exists between {@code nodeA} and {@code nodeB},
   * and in the same direction.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an edge (other than {@code edge}) already
   *         exists from {@code nodeA} to {@code nodeB}, and this is not a multigraph.
   *         Also, if self-loops are not allowed, and {@code nodeA} is equal to {@code nodeB}.
