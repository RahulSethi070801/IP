   * Returns the {@code k} least elements from the given iterator according to
   * this ordering, in order from least to greatest.  If there are fewer than
   * {@code k} elements present, all will be included.
   *
   * <p>The implementation does not necessarily use a <i>stable</i> sorting
   * algorithm; when multiple elements are equivalent, it is undefined which
   * will come first.
   *
   * @return an immutable {@code RandomAccess} list of the {@code k} least
   *     elements in ascending order
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code k} is negative
