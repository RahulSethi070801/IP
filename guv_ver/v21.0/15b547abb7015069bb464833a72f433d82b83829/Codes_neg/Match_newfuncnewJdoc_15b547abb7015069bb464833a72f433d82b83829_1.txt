   * Returns the equivalent {@code java.util.Optional} value to this optional.
   *
   * <p>Unfortunately, the method reference {@code Optional::toJavaUtil} will not work, because it
   * could refer to either the static or instance version of this method. Write out the lambda
   * expression {@code o -> o.toJavaUtil()} instead.
