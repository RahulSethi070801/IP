   * Returns {@code true} iff {@code graphA} and {@code graphB} have the same elements and the same
   * relationships between elements, as exposed via the {@link Graph} interface.
   *
   * <p>Thus, two graphs A and B are equivalent if both are null or <b>all</b> of the following are
   * true:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link Graph#isDirected() directedness}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link Graph#nodes() node sets}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link Graph#edges() edge sets}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Graph properties besides {@link Graph#isDirected() directedness} do <b>not</b> affect
   * equivalence. For example, two graphs may be considered equivalent even if one allows self-loops
   * and the other doesn't. Additionally, the order in which nodes or edges are added to the graph,
   * and the order in which they are iterated over, are irrelevant.
