   * Returns the number of edges {@linkplain #incidentEdges(Object) incident} in this graph
   * to {@code node}.  If this node has more than {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} incident edges
   * in this graph, returns {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
   *
   * <p>Equivalent to {@code incidentEdges(node).size()}.
   *
   * <p>Note that self-loops only count once towards a node's degree.
   * This is consistent with the definition of {@link #incidentEdges(Object)}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code node} is not an element of this graph
