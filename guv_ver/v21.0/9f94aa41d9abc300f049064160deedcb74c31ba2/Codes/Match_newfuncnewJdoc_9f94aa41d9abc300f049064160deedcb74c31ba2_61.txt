   * Specifies the weigher to use in determining the weight of entries. Entry weight is taken into
   * consideration by {@link #maximumWeight(long)} when determining which entries to evict, and use
   * of this method requires a corresponding call to {@link #maximumWeight(long)} prior to calling
   * {@link #build}. Weights are measured and recorded when entries are inserted into the cache, and
   * are thus effectively static during the lifetime of a cache entry.
   *
   * <p>When the weight of an entry is zero it will not be considered for size-based eviction
   * (though it still may be evicted by other means).
   *
   * <p><b>Important note:</b> Instead of returning <em>this</em> as a {@code CacheBuilder}
   * instance, this method returns {@code CacheBuilder<K1, V1>}. From this point on, either the
   * original reference or the returned reference may be used to complete configuration and build
   * the cache, but only the "generic" one is type-safe. That is, it will properly prevent you from
   * building caches whose key or value types are incompatible with the types accepted by the
   * weigher already provided; the {@code CacheBuilder} type cannot do this. For best results,
   * simply use the standard method-chaining idiom, as illustrated in the documentation at top,
   * configuring a {@code CacheBuilder} and building your {@link Cache} all in a single statement.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> if you ignore the above advice, and use this {@code CacheBuilder} to build a
   * cache whose key or value type is incompatible with the weigher, you will likely experience a
   * {@link ClassCastException} at some <i>undefined</i> point in the future.
