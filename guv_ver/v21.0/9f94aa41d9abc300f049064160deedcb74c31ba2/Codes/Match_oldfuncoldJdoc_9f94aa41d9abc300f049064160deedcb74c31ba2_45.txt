   * Guides the allowed concurrency among update operations. Used as a hint for internal sizing. The
   * table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates
   * without contention. Because assignment of entries to these partitions is not necessarily
   * uniform, the actual concurrency observed may vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to
   * accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly
   * higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead
   * to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not
   * usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one permits only one thread to modify the cache
   * at a time, but since read operations and cache loading computations can proceed concurrently,
   * this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization.
   *
   * <p> Defaults to 4. <b>Note:</b>The default may change in the future. If you care about this
   * value, you should always choose it explicitly.
   *
   * <p>The current implementation uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
   * segments, each governed by its own write lock. The segment lock is taken once for each explicit
   * write, and twice for each cache loading computation (once prior to loading the new value,
   * and once after loading completes). Much internal cache management is performed at the segment
   * granularity. For example, access queues and write queues are kept per segment when they are
   * required by the selected eviction algorithm. As such, when writing unit tests it is not
   * uncommon to specify {@code concurrencyLevel(1)} in order to achieve more deterministic eviction
   * behavior.
   *
   * <p>Note that future implementations may abandon segment locking in favor of more advanced
   * concurrency controls.
