   * Returns the index of the first matching character in a character sequence, starting from a
   * given position, or {@code -1} if no character matches after that position.
   *
   * <p>The default implementation iterates over the sequence in forward order, beginning at {@code
   * start}, calling {@link #matches} for each character.
   *
   * @param sequence the character sequence to examine
   * @param start the first index to examine; must be nonnegative and no greater than {@code
   *        sequence.length()}
   * @return the index of the first matching character, guaranteed to be no less than {@code start},
   *         or {@code -1} if no character matches
   * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if start is negative or greater than {@code
   *         sequence.length()}
