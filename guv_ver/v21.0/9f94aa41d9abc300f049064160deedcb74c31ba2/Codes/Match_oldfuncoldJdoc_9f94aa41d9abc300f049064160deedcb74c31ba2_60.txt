   * Builds a cache, which either returns an already-loaded value for a given key or atomically
   * computes or retrieves it using the supplied {@code CacheLoader}. If another thread is currently
   * loading the value for this key, simply waits for that thread to finish and returns its
   * loaded value. Note that multiple threads can concurrently load values for distinct keys.
   *
   * <p>This method does not alter the state of this {@code CacheBuilder} instance, so it can be
   * invoked again to create multiple independent caches.
   *
   * @param loader the cache loader used to obtain new values
   * @return a cache having the requested features
