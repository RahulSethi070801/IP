   * Specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain. Note that the cache <b>may evict
   * an entry before this limit is exceeded</b>. As the cache size grows close to the maximum, the
   * cache evicts entries that are less likely to be used again. For example, the cache may evict an
   * entry because it hasn't been used recently or very often.
   *
   * <p>When {@code size} is zero, elements will be evicted immediately after being loaded into the
   * cache. This can be useful in testing, or to disable caching temporarily without a code change.
   *
   * <p>This feature cannot be used in conjunction with {@link #maximumWeight}.
   *
   * @param size the maximum size of the cache
   * @return this {@code CacheBuilder} instance (for chaining)
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code size} is negative
   * @throws IllegalStateException if a maximum size or weight was already set
