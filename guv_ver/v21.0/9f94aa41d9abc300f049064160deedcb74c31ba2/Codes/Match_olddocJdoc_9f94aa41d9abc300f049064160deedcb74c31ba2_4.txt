   * Determines whether a character is whitespace according to the latest Unicode standard, as
   * illustrated <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5Cp%7Bwhitespace%7D">here</a>.
   * This is not the same definition used by other Java APIs. (See a <a
   * href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pd8dAQyHbdewRsnE5x5GzKQ">comparison of several
   * definitions of "whitespace"</a>.)
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> as the Unicode definition evolves, we will modify this matcher to keep it up
   * to date.
