   * Returns the transitive closure of {@code graph}. The transitive closure of a graph is another
   * graph with an edge connecting node A to node B iff node B is {@link #reachableNodes(Graph,
   * Object) reachable} from node A.
   *
   * <p>This is a "snapshot" based on the current topology of {@code graph}, rather than a live view
   * of the transitive closure of {@code graph}. In other words, the returned {@link BasicGraph}
   * will not be updated after modifications to {@code graph}.
