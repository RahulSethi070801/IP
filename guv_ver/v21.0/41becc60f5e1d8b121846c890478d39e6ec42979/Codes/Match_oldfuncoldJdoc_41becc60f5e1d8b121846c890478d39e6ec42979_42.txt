   * Determines whether an edge has already been used during traversal. In the directed case a cycle
   * is always detected before reusing an edge, so no special logic is required. In the undirected
   * case, we must take care not to "backtrack" over an edge (i.e. going from A to B and then going
   * from B to A).
