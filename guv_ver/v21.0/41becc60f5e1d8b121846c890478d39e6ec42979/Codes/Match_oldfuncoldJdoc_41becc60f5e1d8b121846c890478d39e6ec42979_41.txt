   * Returns a live view of this graph as a {@link ValueGraph}. The resulting {@link ValueGraph}

   * A to B.
   *
   * <p>{@link ValueGraph#edgeValue(Object, Object)} will return the set of edges connecting node A
   * to node B. It will return the empty set if there are no edges connecting A to B.
