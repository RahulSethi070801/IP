   * Returns all nodes in this graph adjacent to {@code node} which can be reached by traversing
   * {@code node}'s outgoing edges in the direction (if any) of the edge.
   *
   * <p>This is <i>not</i> the same as "all nodes reachable from {@code node} by following outgoing
   * edges". For that functionality, see {@link Graphs#reachableNodes(Graph, Object)} and {@link
   * Graphs#transitiveClosure(Graph)}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code node} is not an element of this graph
