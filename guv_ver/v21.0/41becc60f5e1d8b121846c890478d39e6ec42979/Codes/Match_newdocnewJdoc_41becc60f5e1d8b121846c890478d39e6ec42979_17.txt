   * Returns {@code true} iff {@code object} is a {@link Graph} that has the same structural
   * relationships as those in this graph.
   *
   * <p>Thus, two graphs A and B are equal if <b>all</b> of the following are true:
   * <ul>
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #isDirected() directedness}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #nodes() node sets}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #edges() edge sets}.
   * <li>Every edge in A and B are associated with equal {@link #edgeValue(Object, Object) values}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Graph properties besides {@link #isDirected() directedness} do <b>not</b> affect equality.
   * For example, two graphs may be considered equal even if one allows self-loops and the other
   * doesn't. Additionally, the order in which nodes or edges are added to the graph, and the order
   * in which they are iterated over, are irrelevant.
   *
   * <p>A reference implementation of this is provided by {@link AbstractGraph#equals(Object)}.
