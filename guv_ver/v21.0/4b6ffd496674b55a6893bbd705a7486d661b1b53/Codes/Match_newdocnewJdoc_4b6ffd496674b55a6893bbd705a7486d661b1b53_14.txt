   * Combines four iterators into a single iterator. The returned iterator
   * iterates across the elements in {@code a}, followed by the elements in
   * {@code b}, followed by the elements in {@code c}, followed by the elements
   * in {@code d}. The source iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding
   * input iterator supports it.
