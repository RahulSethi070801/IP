   * Returns an unmodifiable <b>view</b> of the union of two sets. The returned
   * set contains all elements that are contained in either backing set.
   * Iterating over the returned set iterates first over all the elements of
   * {@code set1}, then over each element of {@code set2}, in order, that is not
   * contained in {@code set1}.
   *
   * <p>Results are undefined if {@code set1} and {@code set2} are sets based on
   * different equivalence relations (as {@link HashSet}, {@link TreeSet}, and
   * the {@link Map#keySet} of an {@code IdentityHashMap} all are).
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> The returned view performs better when {@code set1} is the
   * smaller of the two sets. If you have reason to believe one of your sets
   * will generally be smaller than the other, pass it first.
