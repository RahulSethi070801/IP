   * Combines two iterators into a single iterator. The returned iterator
   * iterates across the elements in {@code a}, followed by the elements in
   * {@code b}. The source iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding
   * input iterator supports it.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> the current implementation is not suitable for nested
   * concatenated iterators, i.e. the following should be avoided when in a loop:
   * {@code iterator = Iterators.concat(iterator, suffix);}, since iteration over the
   * resulting iterator has a cubic complexity to the depth of the nesting.
