   * Combines multiple iterators into a single iterator. The returned iterator
   * iterates across the elements of each iterator in {@code inputs}. The input
   * iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterator supports {@code remove()} when the corresponding
   * input iterator supports it. The methods of the returned iterator may throw
   * {@code NullPointerException} if any of the input iterators is null.
