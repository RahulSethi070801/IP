   * Combines multiple iterables into a single iterable. The returned iterable
   * has an iterator that traverses the elements of each iterable in
   * {@code inputs}. The input iterators are not polled until necessary.
   *
   * <p>The returned iterable's iterator supports {@code remove()} when the
   * corresponding input iterator supports it. The methods of the returned
   * iterable may throw {@code NullPointerException} if any of the input
   * iterators is null.
