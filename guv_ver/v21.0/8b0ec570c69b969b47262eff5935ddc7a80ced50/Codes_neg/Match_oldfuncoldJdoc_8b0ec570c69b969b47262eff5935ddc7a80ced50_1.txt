   * Add nodes that are not elements of the graph, then add {@code edge} between them.
   * Return {@code false} if {@code edge} already exists between {@code node1} and {@code node2},
   * and in the same direction.
   *
   * <p>If this graph is not a multigraph (does not support parallel edges), this method may call
   * {@code edgesConnecting(node1, node2)} to discover whether node1 and node2 are already
   * connected.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an edge (other than {@code edge}) already
   *         exists from {@code node1} to {@code node2}, and this is not a multigraph.
   *         Also, if self-loops are not allowed, and {@code node1} is equal to {@code node2}.
