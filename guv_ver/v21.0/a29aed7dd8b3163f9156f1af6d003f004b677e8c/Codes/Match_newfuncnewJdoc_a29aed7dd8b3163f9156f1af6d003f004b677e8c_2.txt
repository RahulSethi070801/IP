   * Returns the count of {@code node}'s {@link #incidentEdges(Object) incident edges}, counting
   * self-loops twice (equivalently, the number of times an edge touches {@code node}).
   *
   * <p>For directed graphs, this is equivalent to {@code inDegree(node) + outDegree(node)}.
   *
   * <p>For undirected graphs, this is equivalent to {@code incidentEdges(node).size()} + (number
   * of self-loops incident to {@code node}).
   *
   * <p>If the count is greater than {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}, returns {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code node} is not an element of this graph
