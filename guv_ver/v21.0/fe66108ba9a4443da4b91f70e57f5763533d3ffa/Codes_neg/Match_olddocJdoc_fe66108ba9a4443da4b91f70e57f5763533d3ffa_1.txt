   * Returns an instance of {@link InternetDomainName} after lenient
   * validation.  Specifically, validation against <a
   * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt">RFC 3490</a>
   * ("Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications") is skipped, while
   * validation against <a
   * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a> is relaxed in
   * the following ways:
   * <ul>
   * <li>Any part containing non-ASCII characters is considered valid.
   * <li>Underscores ('_') are permitted within parts (not the first or
   *     last character).
   * <li>Dashes ('-') are permitted as the last character of parts (in
   *     addition to being permitted within parts, per the standard).
   * <li>Parts other than the final part may start with a digit, as mandated
   *     by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123#section-2">RFC
   *     1123</a>.
   * </ul>
