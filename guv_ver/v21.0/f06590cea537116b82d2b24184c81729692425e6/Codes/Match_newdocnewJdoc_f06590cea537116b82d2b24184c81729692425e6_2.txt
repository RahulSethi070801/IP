   * Returns an instance of {@link InternetDomainName} after lenient validation. Specifically,
   * validation against <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt">RFC 3490</a>
   * ("Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications") is skipped, while validation against
   * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a> is relaxed in the following ways:
   * <ul>
   * <li>Any part containing non-ASCII characters is considered valid.
   * <li>Underscores ('_') are permitted wherever dashes ('-') are permitted.
   * <li>Parts other than the final part may start with a digit, as mandated by
   * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123#section-2">RFC 1123</a>.
   * </ul>
   *
   *
   * @param domain A domain name (not IP address)
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code name} is not syntactically valid according to
   *     {@link #isValid}
