   * Returns the string representation of an {@link InetAddress}.
   *
   * <p>For IPv4 addresses, this is identical to
   * {@link InetAddress#getHostAddress()}, but for IPv6 addresses, the output
   * follows <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952">RFC 5952</a>
   * section 4.  The main difference is that this method uses "::" for zero
   * compression, while Java's version uses the uncompressed form.
   *
   * <p>This method uses hexadecimal for all IPv6 addresses, including
   * IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses such as "::c000:201".  The output does not
   * include a Scope ID.
   *
   * @param ip {@link InetAddress} to be converted to an address string
