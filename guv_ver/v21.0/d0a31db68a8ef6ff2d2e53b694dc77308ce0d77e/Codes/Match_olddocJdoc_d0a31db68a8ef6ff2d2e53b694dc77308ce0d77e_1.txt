   * Returns {@code true} iff {@code object} is a {@link Network} that has the same structural
   * relationships as those in this network.
   *
   * <p>Thus, two networks A and B are equal if <b>all</b> of the following are true:
   * <ul>
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #isDirected() directedness}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #nodes() node sets}.
   * <li>A and B have equal {@link #edges() edge sets}.
   * <li>Every edge in A and B connects the same nodes in the same direction (if any).
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Network properties besides {@link #isDirected() directedness} do <b>not</b> affect equality.
   * For example, two networks may be considered equal even if one allows parallel edges and the
   * other doesn't. Additionally, the order in which nodes or edges are added to the network, and
   * the order in which they are iterated over, are irrelevant.
   *
   * <p>A reference implementation of this is provided by {@link AbstractNetwork#equals(Object)}.
