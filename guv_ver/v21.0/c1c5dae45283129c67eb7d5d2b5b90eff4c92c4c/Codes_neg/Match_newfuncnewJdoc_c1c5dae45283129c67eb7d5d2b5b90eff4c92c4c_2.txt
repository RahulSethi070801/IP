   * Returns {@code true} iff {@code object} is a graph that has the same node/edge relationships
   * as those in this graph.
   *
   * <p>Thus, two graphs A and B are equal if <b>all</b> of the following are true:
   * <ul>
   * <li>A and B have the same node set
   * <li>A and B have the same edge set
   * <li>A and B have the same incidence relationships, e.g., for each node/edge in A and in B
   *     its incident edge/node set in A is the same as its incident edge/node set in B.
   *     <br>Thus, every edge in A and B connect the same nodes in the same direction (if any).
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Graph properties are <b>not</b> respected by this method. For example, two graphs may be
   * considered equal even if one allows parallel edges and the other doesn't. Additionally, the
   * order in which edges or nodes are added to the graph, and the order in which they are iterated
   * over, are irrelevant.
   *
   * <p>A reference implementation of this is provided by {@link Graphs#equal(Graph, Graph)}.
