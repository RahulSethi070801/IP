   * Creates an empty {@code Set} that uses identity to determine equality. It
   * compares object references, instead of calling {@code equals}, to
   * determine whether a provided object matches an element in the set. For
   * example, {@code contains} returns {@code false} when passed an object that
   * equals a set member, but isn't the same instance. This behavior is similar
   * to the way {@code IdentityHashMap} handles key lookups.
