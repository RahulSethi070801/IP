   * Creates a thread-safe set backed by a hash map. The set is backed by a
   * {@link ConcurrentHashMap} instance, and thus carries the same concurrency
   * guarantees.
   *
   * <p>Unlike {@code HashSet}, this class does NOT allow {@code null} to be
   * used as an element. The set is serializable.
   *
   * @return a new, empty thread-safe {@code Set}
